Firstly, the restructuring following a change of operator when the site was bought in 2003 plays a role. As part of that process, the in-house masonry department, which had until that time carried out inspections and maintenance of the chemical wastewater shafts, was dismantled. There was a lack of awareness of what this step would mean for plant safety or of the need to replace the department. The second main cause was a lack of coordination between the operator and the VAwS expert on regular inspections. The operator was clearly not sure what exactly had to be inspected and to what extent.

Of particular importance are aspects concerning plant integrity (inspection, upkeep and maintenance). The impact on safety may not become apparent for a considerable time. The safety management system must also take into consideration organisational changes. It is recommended that such organisational changes are also taken into consideration by the authorities in conjunction with supervision.– A lack of coordination of regular inspection and testing measures may lead to incorrect interpretations when assessing the state of the equipment.– Clear findings with written descriptions and images are therefore required in order to establish the scope and detail of the inspection and the methods used. The inspection report (results) should contain a comprehensible description of the inspection carried out and an expert opinion. In particular, the results of visual inspections should be explained."

Causes - Organisational","Lessons learned:

It is necessary to identify risks in order to introduce appropriate and robust mitigation measures, e.g. design, procedures, etc.
Dangers caused by the release of substances are not necessarily limited to the primary medium in which they are contained.
Opening the system with only a single block in the process is a risk, which requires particular consideration and for which measures appropriate to the operating permit must be introduced.
A high level of risk-awareness — including for routine work and the associated danger of risk normalisation — is required.
For hazardous activities, the worst-case scenario must be borne in mind.
Details recorded in shift logs can also assist with early identification of risks.
Tightening of a shut-off valve when the system is open can cause a sudden increase in the size of a leak.
Following training, checks are required to encourage the use of training content in the field.

Measures:

Risk awareness programme focusing on single block systems, ‘worst-case’ thinking, on-site inspection of hazardous activities, raising awareness of risk normalisation and communicating and discussing lessons learned from this incident.
Improvements in organisation and procedures: specification of more intensive risk analysis criteria as part of the operating authorisation procedure, improved communication during shift changeover, following up on training and revising the procedures concerned.

Technology: improved pipe routing and installation of a double block on these pumps, assessment of further technological measures and development of criteria for a subsequent review of technologically similar systems."

20,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"SYSTEM ORIGINATING AND OPERATING CONDITIONS:
Storage area of the second cold rolling mill's pickling section.

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
In a sodium hypochlorite transfer tank, an unknown amount of sodium hypochlorite flowed into the overfilling pipe owing to the blockage of the float valve (due to the presence of crystals) that controlled the level in the tank. Therefore, when the level reached the maximum value, the valve did not stop the pump. The overfilling pipe was connected with a tank installed below, covered with a metal grid, which was containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite with the two acids produced chlorine gas and probably fluoride gas. The release occurred at 08:45 am. In the area there were 6 employees and each of them noticed a strong smell of chlorine and left the building as soon as possible. The security department was immediately alerted which in turn alerted the medical service and the management. A 4 men rescue team was formed and instructed to enter the pickling section to check if someone was still there. They were also instructed to switch-off the equipment. The rescue team found that the sodium hydroxide transfer tank had overflowed and the liquid had run into the tank below containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The pump which was transferring the sodium hypochloryte from the storage tank to the transfer tank had already stopped. Since chlorine gas is heavier than air, it was expected that it would take some time for the chlorine vapours to disperse from the building. At about 17:00 hours the production was started up again since no more than 1ppm concentration of chlorine could be detected in the production hall by means of Draeger tubes.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,,,,,,,"01.

The overfilling pipe was connected with a tank installed below, covered with a metal grid, which was containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite (a very strong oxidizing agent) with the two acids produced chlorine gas (by oxidation of chlorides) and probably fluoride gas (by oxidation of fluorides) but there is no evidence of it.

CAUSES:
In a sodium hypochlorite transfer tank, an unknown amount of sodium hypochlorite flowed into the overfilling pipe owing to the blockage of the float valve (due to the presence of crystals) that controlled the level in the tank. Therefore, when the level reached the maximum value, the valve did not stop the pump (the control had only temporarily jammed since the rescue team found that the pump had automatically stopped). The overfilling pipe was connected with a tank installed below, covered with a metal grid, which was containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The reaction of the sodium hypochlorite (a very strong oxidizing agent) with the two acids produced chlorine gas (by oxidation of chlorides) and probably fluoride gas (by oxidation of fluorides) but there is no evidence of it.
Besides, the emergency level (i.e. the level at which the stop signal was given to the transfer pump) was too close to the overfilling pipe. This, together with the excessive length (about 75 metres) of the piping between the pump and the transfer tank, may cause the tank overfilling even if the pump stops when the liquid reaches the emergency level.
Finally, the overfilling pipe from the transfer tank was erroneously connected (due to inadequate process analysis and plant design) with the tank below which may contain acids.Remarks: No data are
available about the amount of released sodium hypochlorite and of
nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride contained in the transfer tank. Also
no data are available about the amount of the chlorine gas formed by
the reaction of sodium hypochlorite with nitric acid and hydrogen
fluoride.","instrument/control/monitoring-device failure

21,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
During the start-up, an explosion occurred in the redistillation column of the ethylene oxide plant which came into operation in 1969 in a petrochemical industry. This plant had been shut-down in June from 1 to 23. When it was started up problems were experienced in stabilizing the column and a number of repairs were made to the pumps and instrumentation. On the day of the explosion, the column was sufficiently stable. When the explosion occurred all the employees were by chance in the control room. No alarm signals sounded during the last 30 minutes before the explosion occurred except the general alarm that sounded a few seconds before. Despite of the difficult internal communication caused by the destruction of the internal telephone and alarm systems and the emergency control centre, the operators started to shut-down the other plants of the factory and to fight the fire. The external emergency services and the authorities were informed on the accident and the emergency plan for the Antwerp harbour was activated. The emergency services arrived on site in 10 minutes and with the help of the factory's operators put out the fire and the release of chemicals within half an hour. 13 operators (two of them were of an external factory working for BP Chemicals) and a person outside the establishment (working in a neighbouring factory) were slightly hurt. The most serious injury was a broken arm. There were considerable damages inside the establishment: the redistillation column (32 metres high and 2.3 metres in diameter) was completely destroyed and pieces were found up to 700 metres away, some in a neighbouring factory. The ethylene oxide plant and other nearby plants were seriously damaged. Most of the buildings in a radius of 300 metres were damaged. The internal alarm and telephone systems were damaged and could not be used. The emergency control room was also unusable. Outside the establishment, window panes were broken in neighbouring factories and the nearby village of Zwijndrecht (about 1 km away). Nobody was hurt in the village.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,"06. FLAMMABLE - note 3(a)
00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","CAUSES:
The accident was caused by the decomposition of ethylene oxide at the base section of the redistillation column. There are two possible causes for this accident:
1- a leak of ethylene oxide from a flange that had been insulated during shut-down. During the start-up, the released ethylene oxide reacted exothermically with the binders of the lagging and this caused a temperature increase that ignited the ethylene oxide;
2. the development of a hot spot in a quiescent area of the column caused by the polymerization of ethylene oxide catalysed by rust deposits (this is less likely because no conclusive evidence of it was found).",,,,,,,"MEASURES
TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:
After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- flanges must not be insulated. If insulation was necessary, the
insulation material had to be checked on a possible reaction with
ethylene oxide. Use of proper gaskets for flanges;
2- all pipeworks and pieces of equipment that may contain rust must be
cleaned and inspected before restarting the installation.
MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:
After the accident, the following measures were established:
1- improvement of both communication and alarm systems;
2- installation of a second control room to be used in emergency
situations;
3- modifications of the access system;
4- revision of the internal emergency plan including a better method of
identifying people on-site;
5- additional access road to the establishment;
6- improvement of the existing supply for fire fighting water. ;"
22,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A corroded pipe in the degassing system ruptured after the wrong admission of liquid vinyl chloride and a leakage of about 4 tonnes of this substance occurred before its isolation. A layer of the escaped gas developped close to the drain ditches of the area where the leakage occurred. The vinyl chloride vapours, being 2.5 times heavier than air, remained closed to the ground. The slightly elevated rails of the railway serving the area acted initially as a dike and contained the gas cloud. Atmospheric conditions and  water curtains created by the plant fire brigade managed to contain the cloud close to the leakage point until it had been diluted by convection. The evaporation of liquid vinyl chloride had been promoted by the water draining from the water curtains. The source of the release was identified 45 minutes after the leakage was detected; the leaking pipeline was isolated soon after that. The company firemen checked the roads around the factory with explosimeters and the response was negative everywhere. Besides, they irrigated the area where the leakage occurred and made a screen from each side. The Security chief called Service 100 to signal the leak and to ask the firemen to take up position around the factory in case gas layer moved to the outside. Sambreville fire brigade was called and took position around the plant fence on the side opposite the site of the leak but its intervention was not necessary, since repeated gas concentration measuremets at the boundary of the factory resulted negative. The railway traffic in the city of Jemeppe was interrupted during the accident, from 23:32 till 03:08 next morning. The goods trains were stopped where they were whilst the international traffic was diverted via Brussels. The leakage had been detected at 23:10, the leaking point had been identified at 23:55 and the piping isolation took place around 00:05. From this moment, the leakage was decreasing until the gas cloud was practically dispersed at 01:30.

23,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
Ethylene oxide leaked through a hair-crack in a weld on the distillation column K-303 (aldehyde column) and contaminated the rock-wool insulation of a level indicator. The leak was caused by a hair-crack due to low cycle fatigue. The released ethylene oxide reacted with moisture to form non-volatile polyethylene glycols (PEG) in the insulation material. PEG accumulated in the course of time. On the day of the accident, the metal covering of the insulation was removed in order to repair the level indicator. Air leaked into the insulation material already soaked with PEG, causing its decomposition and initiating auto-oxidation. The auto-oxidation of the PEG ignited the insulation and the resulting heat flux heated the metal wall of the piping of the level instrumentation system. The heating of the stagnant liquid of the level instrument stand pipe caused the ethylene oxide to decompose. The decomposition continued into the column K-303 which exploded (the confined vapour explosion began in the lower section of the column). The gas supply line to column K-302 (carrying gases from the head of column K-303) was torn off and the escaping gas caught fire. After the pressure decreased, the flames backed into the column K-302 and caused an internal explosion (approximately 26 seconds after the first explosion). The two explosions caused the impact of debris in other sections of the ethylene oxide/glycol installation and was followed by a huge fire. The recycle gas loop was hit by debris and the released gas burned as a jet-fire. The plant fire fighting team was able to confine the fire and to put it under control in less than one hour.

41,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"1. ; ; ; SituationThe storage terminal contains 7 storage tanks in one large bund. The bund is made of earth. The terminal is situated at some distance from the refinery it is connected with.- ; ; ; 4 large crude oil tanks of which 3 are situated in a row and a fourth crude oil tank is situated before the second tank. These storage tanks are identified as D1, D2, D3 and D4;- ; ; ; 2 smaller slop oil tanks, D10 and D11;- ; ; ; a very small crude oil tank D26.The crude oil tanks D1, D2, D3 and D4 have a capacity of 40 000 m3 and the slop oil tanks D10 and D11 have a capacity of 24 000 m3.The crude oil is delivered by pipeline and is pumped by pipeline to the Refinery.On September 12th, 2005 a minor incident occurred at the storage tank D3. During this incident an amount of 35 m3 crude oil leaked from the bottom of the tank. The exact cause of this incident is not yet known. At the moment the major accident occurred with tank D2 cleaning operations for storage tank D3 were just started in order to inspect storage tank D3 and to determine the causes of the incident of September 12th.At the moment the major accident happened the slop oil tank D10 was full, the slop oil tank D11 was empty, the crude oil tank D4 was partially full, the crude oil tank D2 was for 75% full en the tanks D1, D3 en D26 were empty and in revision.2. ; ; ;  ;Chronological description of the accident and the interventionOn October 25, 2005 around 18.15h a major leak at tank D2 was detected. Storage tank D2 contained at that moment almost 33 000 m3 crude oil. Information from the DCS-system situated in the off-sites control room of the refinery indicates that the full inventory of storage tank D2 was released within 10 minutes. Because the contents of the storage tank was released in such a short time, an enormous wave appeared. Due to the amount of crude that was released, the bund was filled ( 40 000 m2 large) with crude up to ; a height of 1 m. Due to the effect of the crude wave, a small amount of 3 m3 of crude was ejected out of the bund into a nearby creek.After the release the storage tank was leaning forward. It also seamed that the storage tank was sledded of his foundation, although it is not clear if this was a cause or rather a consequence of the incident. Initially the fire brigade started to cover the bund with fire fighting foam to avoid ignition of the crude oil and to reduce the smell. Directly a large amount of fire fighting foam was donated by the Refinery, other (petro)chemical companies and the fire brigade to cover the very large bund area with foam. ; Due to the very strong wind that evening and the use of different types of fire fighting foam they did not succeeded to cover the whole bund with foam. Especially the inner part of the large bund (where al the piping and valves are situated) stayed even after several hours uncovered. On the other hand the strong wind had the advantage that no explosive atmosphere was formed above the spill.The contents of the slop oil tank D10 and the crude oil tank D4 was immediatly pumped to storage tanks situated at the refinery itself. The contents of the bund is firstly pumped to the slop oil tank D11. In order to fill the slop oil tank D10 and de crude oil tank D4 with the product in the bund, some manual valves had to be handled. Because of the presence of piping, valves and walking platforms in the bund, is was not possible to reach the valves by boat. Therefore two operators (fully protected with chemical overalls and breathing apparatus) have walked through the crude and manipulated the valves.During the next two days the mixture of crude oil, fire fighting foam and water was pumped to the storage tanks D10 and D4. This was done at a velocity of 900 m3 an hour. Afterwards a part of this mixture was send to storage tanks at the refinery. In the afternoon of October 27th , 2005 the bund was mostly empty, except of some smaller pools of crude oil. These pools were removed by vacuum cleaning trucks.On October 28th, 2005 the intervention was finished and the cleaning up of the terminal could start. 3. ; ; ; CommentsThe storage tank D2 was built in 1970. At that moment the storage terminal belonged to XX. It was sold in 1990 to the Refinery. At that moment all the tanks were inspected and repaired if necessary. This was also the case for storage tank D2. The inspection before the tank D2 was used again was done in 1991. From 1994 until now each 3 years an external inspection was performed. These inspections showed almost no remarks. Next year a total revision of the storage tank was planned. Every three years setting measurements of the storage tanks were carried out. The last measurements were done in 2004. These measurements showed no anomalies.At this moment the cause of this major accident is not yet know. There are some indications that a subsidence (movement of the soil) could have caused this accident, because one month before this accident the crude oil tank D3 also had a leak. More investigation on both tanks is necessary to know if both accidents are related with each other.Two days after the accident, the bund was nearly empty. At that moment it was clearly visible that a part of the foundation of storage tank D2 had disappeared. Parts of the foundation were found in the bund over a distance of 20 to 30 m. An important concern after the accident is the stability of all storage tanks at the storage terminal at the left bank. For the moment each day setting measurements are performed. To reduce the risk of another release, most part of the contents of the storage tanks D4, D10 and D11 are pumped to the refinery where it was shipped to Rotterdam. Afterwards these tanks were partially filled with water in order to let the roof float.For the moment the terminal only contains sludge. This sludge is present in the storage tanks D4, D10, D11 and D2.After the accident the company organized already 8 inspections with the authorities in order to discuss al measures they are taking concerning safety and environment. Also a public hearing for the neighbourhood was organized.4. ; ; ; Clean-up operationsThe Refinery has set up a project group in order to make the terminal safe and start the cleaning of the terminal.In order to reduce the smell in the neighbourhood. The bund area is covered with sand, except the zone in front of the storage tank D2. Because the tank is leaning forward, it was not safe to enter the bund and in that area a lot of sludge was still present. This sludge containing a lot of sand is very viscous and has an average depth of 1 m.From November 6th, 2005 the storage tank D2 is stabilized by 4 mayor cranes. These cranes that can support the total mass of the storage tank are placed on a service way just outside the bund.After the stabilisation of the storage tank D2, two manholes of the storage tank were opened. Measurements indicated that the atmosphere in the storage tank was not explosive. They also saw that the floating roof had properly landed on his supports (legs). Nevertheless the company does not want operators to enter the storage tank to remove the sludge. For that reason they have ordered a robot to suck the sludge out of the storage tank.In the next week a profound investigation of the soil will start. Firstly drillings until a depth of 2 to 3 m will be performed to measure the soil contamination. Afterwards drilling until a depth of 25 to 30 m will be performed to measure the stability of the soil at the terminal and in the surroundings.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to ground,,,,,,,,,02.

Emergency Response","6.1. Detection of the problemJust as for each process equipment with risks for major accidents, the phenomena which can lead to a degradation of the containment, in this case the storage tank, should be identified and analysed.This accident indicates the possible risks as a consequence of the presence of non mixable phases which can settle out. An investigation of the possible presence of such phases should form a part of the identification of possible corrosive phenomena. If necessary chemical analyses should be performed to determine the corrosive behaviour of these phases (chemical composition, pH,#).This incident further shows that in the bottom of storage tanks gutters can be formed. In those gutters corrosive products can accumulate, what can result in local, uniform corrosion. In the case water and/or other corrosive products can induce corrosion of the tank bottom, it should be investigated if there is also a problem of gutter forming in the bottom.Gutter forming in the bottom of storage tanks is induced by a combination of the size of the storage tank, the local compressibility of the foundation and a relative elastic underground. The gutters are not always visible by the eye. They can be mapped by performing a topographic investigation. The topographic maps are achieved by a surveyor who measures the bottom of the storage tank with a laser.The local uniform corrosion which is a consequence of the gutter forming is not easily detected. The local reduction of the thickness of the bottom plate can be overlooked if ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed on a cross banded pattern. If the risk of local corrosion due to gutter forming in the bottom exists, suitable techniques should be used to investigate the bottom plates. These techniques are described below.6.2. Possible solutionsIf local, uniform corrosion induced by gutter forming is a problem, the company should take suitable measures to avoid a loss of containment as a consequence of the corrosion. In the next paragraph some different possible measures are listed according to the place they take in the prevention hierarchy. In function of the specific situation it can be necessary to take multiple measures, if necessary completed with additional measures which are not described here.1. ; ; ; Avoiding or limiting the presence of corrosive products that can settle out.2. ; ; ; Avoid that products settle out (mixing the different phases)Mixing of the products in the storage tank can avoid or limit that insoluble phases settle out. To achieve good results the effectiveness of the mixing is important.3. ; ; ; Removing of settled out productsIt has to be assured by a procedure that settled out products are periodically removed. But note that the draining of settled out products does not guarantee that settlements are removed out of gutters in the bottom. ; ; ; 4. ; ; ; Avoiding the formation of gutters in the bottomExisting storage tanks can be lifted up and the foundation underneath can be restored. In this case it must be kept in mind that by performing a hydrostatic test it is possible that new settlements can take place. For existing tanks there is also the possibility to analyse the foundation and the underground under the storage tanks in order to gather enough information to perform calculations. These calculations can indicate if the risk of gutter forming exists or not. For new storage tanks a detailed calculations of the foundations can be performed during the design phase to reduce the risk of gutter formation.5. ; ; ; LiningA lining is applied on the tank bottom and the first shell course. A lining which is well attached will largely reduce the corrosion velocity. A badly adjusted lining will still reduce the uniform corrosion but will promote pitting corrosion underneath the lining. A good attachment of a lining depends on a lot of parameters such as moisture, temperature, kind of lining, not stepping on a not fully hardened layer,#. ; To achieve guarantee about the thickness of the lining and the attachment of the lining it is necessary to perform measurements on the thickness of the different layers, to perform a conductivity test and to perform a non porosity test. The code API 652 ""Linings of aboveground petroleum storage tank bottoms"" describes the advantages and disadvantages of different kind of linings.6. ; ; ; Planning of internal inspections based on the corrosion velocityThe intervals between internal inspections have to be defined based on the estimated corrosion velocity. This is a general principle that can be found in de API 653 standard ""Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction"". Normally the corrosion velocity of the bottom plates is the most important one. In the case of major local corrosion, it will be this higher, local corrosion velocity which is determinative for the inspection interval.The internal corrosion velocity can be determined by analysing the settled out products. Based on graphics which indicate the overall corrosion velocity of the construction material as a function of the corrosive character of these residues (e.g. pH-measurement), the corrosion velocity can be estimated. Based on the corrosion velocity it can be determined how long the storage tank can be safely used before a next internal inspection is necessary. API 653 describes what minimum plate thicknesses have to be measured to use a storage tank safely. If it is expected that large differences can occur in the chemical composition and the properties of the residues, these analyses and the calculation of the inspection interval must be periodically repeated. The analysis of the bottom products can be used to trace other corrosion phenomena (e.g. bacteriological corrosion). ; 7. ; ; ; Adapted internal inspection techniquesInternal inspections in which case ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed in a cross banded pattern (just to achieve a general impression of the thickness of the bottom of the storage tank) are not sufficient to trace local, uniform corrosion.In order to achieve an entire image of all changes in the thickness of the bottom of a storage tank the bottom must be totally scanned. Floor scans are very useful to measure sudden volume changes in the floor (e.g. pitting corrosion). They can however also be used to trace gradual changes in the thickness of the bottom plates. To guarantee that a floor scan generates accurate information on the state of the entire bottom of the storage tank, certain conditions have to be satisfied.It must be checked if the presence of a lining has an influence on the results of the floor scan.Before the inspection is must be clearly discussed with the performers in which state the storage tank must be presented to achieve good measurements. In some cases the entire bottom of the storage tank must be sand blasted before measurements can be performed. In this case it is necessary to discuss the criteria for the sand blasting in advance. It is also favourable that the contractor who will perform the floor scan inspects the cleaning conditions of the bottom plates.The signal that is generated by the floor scanning apparatus can suffer from drift. This phenomenon is not necessarily a problem if the floor scanning is used to detect pitting corrosion. The moment pitting corrosion is detected, the signal changes so much that even with some drift on the signal, the pitting corrosion is detected. The drift on the electric signal has however a much larger impact when floor scanning is used to detect gradual changes in the bottom floor. To solve this problem it is useful to perform a few ultrasonic thickness measurements on each bottom plate. The signal from the floor scanning apparatus can be gauged for each bottom plate in order to achieve accurate measurements on gradual changes in the bottom thickness.8. ; ; ; Additional external inspection techniquesIn addition to the above described internal inspections, intermediate external inspections can be performed in order to gather additional information on the corrosion status of the storage tanks. These inspection techniques, which can be applied when the storage tanks are in duty, are especially useful when there is large uncertainty on the corrosion phenomena and/or on the corrosion velocity.A first technique uses acoustic emission measurements. Microphones are placed on the shell of the storage tank to receive sound waves coming out of the tank. Each sound wave is stored and the source of the noise is calculated by software. The sounds that can be associated with a general corrosion activity have a very high frequency. The data are processed in order to map the places where corrosion activity is found and to determine the density of the corrosion activity. The technique makes it also possible to determine different grades of corrosion activity, going from grade A (very small) to grade E(high corrosion activity). As a function of the established corrosion activity it can be decided to perform immediately an internal inspection on the storage tank (in case of grade E), to reschedule the next internal inspection to an earlier date or to repeat the acoustic emission measurements after a certain period.The acoustic emission technique also allows to detect leaks. These leaks are detected at other frequencies than the frequencies at which the general corrosion activity is detected. This technique makes it possible to detect small perforations in the tank bottom.Another technique to achieve an indication of certain corrosion phenomena is ""long range ultrasonics"". This technique admits to achieve a qualitative image of the status of the annular bottom plates (not from the entire tank bottom) by using guided waves.These external inspection techniques do not gather (quantitative) information about the corrosion velocity and can't be used to enlarge the inspection interval that is based on the corrosion velocity.9. ; ; ; Applying leak detection techniquesSeveral techniques can be applied to detect a leak in the bottom of a storage tank while the storage tank is in duty.A possible leak detection technique exists of cables placed in the underground at fixed distances. The conductivity of these cables changes if a product is detected in the underground.Larger leaks can be detected by looking for abnormal deviations in the fluid level in the storage tank. If a continuous level measurement is installed on the storage tank, it is possible to install an extra alarm in the control program. The alarm is generated when the fluid level decreases when there are no pumping activities out of the storage tank. "
42,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"The accident, its development and consequencesOn the 6th of September 2005 about 200 m# (~150 tonnes) red gas oil was released in the docks of the port of Antwerp. The accident took place at the Petroplus Refinery facility in Antwerp, Belgium. During the loading of red gas oil ; from a land tank to a ship an overfilling of one of the tanks on the ship occurred. The overfilling went on for about 20 minutes before the loading operation was stopped. As a result, 193 m# of the product was released in the surface water.

43,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"On Wednesday may 4th around 20.00h, a short but intensive fire took place at the naphtha cracking unit of the Total Refinery Antwerp.Ten ovens are part of the naphtha cracking unit. In these ovens the feed stream naphtha is cracked into smaller molecules. Periodically these ovens need to be decoked to assure an optimal cracking of the molecules. When the accident took place the oven B20 had to be decoked. ; To start the decoking procedure, the feed to the oven must be closed. Next the oven must be flushed with steam. Afterwards an air flow is sent into the oven to burn the carbon, which is deposed at the inner walls of the cracking tubes, in a controlled manner. Around 19.15h the naphtha feed to the oven B20 was stopped by closing a automatic valve. The 4 control valves (not at the entrance of the oven were also closed. The operator in the control room performed these actions. After performing these remote actions, some manual operations had to take place in the neighborhood of the ovens. A figure indicating the configuration of the valves involved in the accident and their final state after the accident is attached to the report.The manual actions that had to be performed were the following ones:- ; ; ; First a manual valve placed just before the automatic valve on the naphtha feed had to be closed. On the figure this manual valve is situated left from the automatic valve;- ; ; ; Next the naphtha feed line had to be flushed with steam for a short period (called short steam flush). To do so the automatic valve had to be opened manually;- ; ; ; Afterwards the drain situated between the manual valve and the automatic valve had to be opened to let the steam escape. By doing so the remaining naphtha in the feed pipe between the manual and automatic valve could be removed;- ; ; ; After the remaining naphtha was removed, a blind plate had to be placed under the manual valve, in order to guarantee that during the decoking of the ovens it is impossible to sent naphtha to the oven (by mistake).- ; ; ; Finally the oven had to be flushed with steam during 30 minutes (called long steam flush).Just before the accident happened the two victims were situated in the neighborhood of the valves that had to be manipulated. Other operators who were working 30 to 40 m away from that place suddenly heard a thud explosion followed by an intensive fire.Because sprinklers were situated above the valves, a water curtain was available in the immediate surroundings of the valves and monitors were available to the north and south of the place of the fire, the fire was extinguished after a few minutes.After the fire was extinguished it was established that the drain situated right from the automatic valve was opened and the plug, which is usually used to guarantee that no fluid is leaking out of the drain (if the drain valve leaks a little bit), was found on the floor. This drain was another one than the one described in the list of manual actions that had to be performed before the oven could be decoked.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)",,,,,,,08. EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE - note 3(c),"Chronology of the accidentThe two victims, who were still following the training program to become operators, went to the place where the valves should be manipulated before starting the decoking of oven B20. The operator, who had the function of ""oven operator"" in that shift, had the intention to follow them (after he found his helmet).One of the operators in training has opened the drain right from the automatic valve. A lot of naphtha came out of the drain. The amount of naphtha that was released was much more than he expected and much more than the amount that came free the other times he performed this task. The amount of naphtha that came free must have been 300 to 400l, this is the contents of the line between the automatic valve and the inlet of the oven. Once he noticed that a lot of naphtha that was released, he wanted to close the drain valve, but it was already too late. He saw the cloud of naphtha was ignited by the hot walls of the nearby oven. The description of the actions the operator in training performed was in line with the situation in which the installation was found after the fire. The operator in training claimed that he did not perform the actions in another way than he normally did to decoke an oven. Although he was still following the training program to become ""oven operator"" he performed this task already several times (but he did not now how many times).Direct causesOne of the most important causes of this accident is the fact that two operators who were still following the training program to become ""oven operator"" were performing tasks without any supervision.The day the accident happened there were enough operators available in the evening shift to fulfill all necessary functions. In the shift it was decided that the manual tasks before decoking oven B20 should be performed by the two victims. The operators in the shift believed that the two victims had already enough knowledge and experience to perform these actions correctly. One hour before they had to perform these tasks, the operator with the function ""oven operator"" explained to them that they were going to decoke oven B20 and what they had to do. Unfortunately this was not put into a report. The moment the operator in the control room announced that de automatic valve on the naphtha feed was closed, the two victims got the instruction to perform the manual tasks. The operator who had the function of ""oven operator"" had the intention to follow them after he found his helmet. The moment the operator left the building the fire already started.In the shift there was a lot of confidence in the knowledge of the two operators in training. Their training file contained already personal notes with the answer on the question which actions they had to perform for the decoking of an oven. The answer of the second victim was correct, but it described the tasks more generally. The answer of the first victim contained all the details of the manual actions that had to be taken before the oven can be decoked. The operators in training answered that question as a preparation of the examination that they had to pass to become a certified operator to perform the function of ""oven operator"".During the investigation of the accident it was found that the two victims had followed an operator performing the manual tasks before the decoking of an oven several times. The ovens in the naphtha cracking unit are installed by two. Therefore the configuration of the naphtha feed and the corresponding valves of the odd ovens is the mirror image of the configurations of the even ovens. Because the two operators in training assisted the manual actions on several ovens, they where aware of the fact that there are two ""mirror image"" configurations. Although it could be demonstrated that both victims followed the manual tasks several times, it is not recorded how many times they just looked how the ""oven operator"" did it and how many times they did it themselves.Indirect causesAs mentioned above the second victim was convinced that the day of the accident he did not do anything different than what he had learned the past months. If this fact was true, it was possible that an operator gave him the wrong instructions during the training period. It is always possible that in order to save some time someone did not perform the short steam flush correctly, but would open the drain directly to release the naphtha between the manual and automatic valve (2 to 3 l naphtha) before performing the long steam flush. If on the day of the accident the second victim would perform the manual tasks in this way and made a mistake between the drain left and right from the automatic valve, this could explain what went wrong the evening of the accident.To exclude that the performing of the manual tasks before decoking an oven had been instructed in the wrong manner, the records stored in the computer system of the decoking actions during the last few months have been printed out. During the short steam flush the automatic valve must be lifted manually. This action is detected on the computer system. If someone would release the naphtha by opening the drain, without a short steam flush, then the automatic valve is not lifted. This difference can be detected by the computer system. The printed files indicated that the past months the ovens were 60 times decoked. The analysis of the printed files also showed that in more than 90% of the cases, it is absolutely sure that the short steam flush was performed correctly. For the other 10 % it was noticed that in some cases it was sure that the actions were not performed correctly, but for some cases it could not be detected if the actions were performed right of wrong. The data stored in the computer system only gives information about the signals that took more than 30 seconds. The short steam flush mostly takes a few minutes, but is more efficiently not to open the automatic valve during two minutes, but to flush several times during a shorter period (to achieve a pumping effect). This means that if an operator lifts the automatic valve 5 times during 20 seconds, these actions are not stored in the computer system, because each period is less than 30 seconds. In the cases where it was sure that the actions were wrong it appeared that these actions could not be related to one shift ore one person. Based on these print outs it can be concluded that de manual actions before decoking an oven are not systematically performed wrongly.",,operator error,training/instruction,,,,
44,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"SUMMARYAt approximately 14.00 on Sunday 9th April there was an explosion followed by a fire at the Distillation Unit 1. The specific distillation column K23 was shut down at the time of the incident for scheduled maintenance when a heat exchanger exploded and the cumene ignited. The automatic systems for foaming were activated and the on-site emergency services were quickly on the scene. They were joined by the external emergency services. The fire was extinguished at 15.23.  ;Two firemen were taken to hospital having come into contact with cumene, a mild irritant. They were released following check-up and have suffered no long-term effects. There was no environmental issue outside of the plant area and there was no risk to the local community. It was found that there was an unexpected accumulation of methyl hydroperoxide (MHP) in the upper part of column K23 during normal operation. During the shut down of the column, the MHP was enriched in the aqueous side draw. Because of specific circumstances parts of this water could flow into the hot heat exchanger, where a thermal explosion of the MHP containing liquid led to an over pressurization of the apparatus. The explosion tore off the feed and outlet pipes. Cumene mainly leaked from the long pipe towards a buffer tank and ignited.  ;Cumene is a colorless, flammable liquid.INCIDENT DESCRIPTIONOn Sunday April 9th K23 was being shutdown in order to perform a regulatory inspection of the column reboiler. ; The shutdown of K23 was being conducted as outlined in the procedure. The first focus in shutting down K23 was stopping the feed and evacuating the bottom of the column. At 13.17, the feed to K23 from the Cumene Extraction Unit was stopped by closing a manual valve at the Cumene Extraction Unit. ; At approximately the same time, the level controller for the sump of K23 was placed in manual operation with a fixed valve position to allow K23 to be pumped empty to Tank 93. The level of K23's sump immediately began to decrease, reaching 10% by 13.19. ; The level remained stable at 10%, although material was continually pumped from K23. ; This is an indication that the level transmitter was not reporting correctly and that the actual level was below the lower nozzle of the level instrument. ; Based on calculations, it is estimated that approximately 1 m3 of material remained in K23 below the lower nozzle of its level instrument. ; At 13.25, K23's bottom pump began to cavitate, indicating that the column was nearly empty, and was shut down at 13.28. ; The bottoms product from K23 is cooled by the feed in a preheater (WBG2336). ; Having already shut off the feed to K23, there was no cooling of the bottoms product as indicated by a temperature rise on the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93. This temperature indicator reached a maximum temperature of 128 °C at 13.24, which is the same time that K23 was empty.The second focus in shutting down K23 was preventing low boiling components from entering the bottom of the column. To ensure that the low boiling components remained in the overheads of the column, the steam flow controller was placed in manual operation at 13.19 and steam input was reduced over a three-minute period. ; At 13.25 the steam condensate temperature increased indicating that heat transfer was no longer taking place due to K23's sump being empty. ; At 13.29, the steam flow was stopped by placing the controller at 0% output. ; The interface level in BBG2305 began increasing at 13.25, indicating the accumulation of additional water in this vessel. ; This level increase was a combined result of shutting off the steam flow to K23 and continuing to reflux material from BBG2303 to the top of K23. ; At 13.39, the reflux flow controller was placed in manual operation at 0% output. ; At 13.54, BBG2305's level controller was placed in manual control at a fixed valve position of 10%. ; The outlet flow from BBG2305 was estimated to be 25 liter/min and resulted in a continuous decrease of the aqueous level in BBG2305. ; At 13.58, the aqueous level in BBG2305 went to 0%, indicating that organic material was then being pumped from BBG2305 to Tank 93.At approximately 14.00 an explosion occurred at WBG2336, which resulted in a fire in the South West corner of Distillation Unit 1. The sprinkler and foam systems for Distillation Unit 1 were immediately activated. The site emergency response team quickly responded to the incident and was later joined by outside emergency services. The fire could not be extinguished until 15.23 due to being unable to successfully isolate fuel sources from the fire.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)",,explosive decomposition (of unstable material),explosive decomposition (of unstable material),,,,"09 ii. DANGEROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT - R51,R53","FAILURE ANALYSISThe explosion occurred at WBG2336, which is a spiral heat exchanger that is used to heat up the feed to K23 by cooling down the bottom product. ; During normal operation the feed is heated and the bottoms product is cooled from 145 °C. ; The feed to K23 enters WBG2336 at the side and exits at the top (cold side of the heat exchanger). The bottom product from K23 enters WBG2336 at the bottom and exits at the side (hot side of the heat exchanger). ; During the modified operation the aqueous side draw from BBG2305 was added to the exit of this stream. Based on the inspection of WBG2336, it was determined that the failure resulted from the over pressurization in the hot side of the heat exchanger. The spiral failed at a pressure between 10 and 15 barg. Such a pressure could be reached by for example a gas explosion. Four scenarios were identified during the incident investigation as possible causes of the over pressurization. The scenarios are as follows:"" ; ;  ;Thermal Expansion occurring during a blocked in condition"" ; ;  ;CHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger"" ; ;  ;MHP slowly decomposing to form hydrogen and oxygen thereby creating an atmosphere which at only low activation energy could lead to an explosion "" ; ;  ;MHP spontaneously decomposing within the exchanger.Thermal ExpansionDuring the shut down of the column there were several manual valves closed in order to isolate K23 from other processes. Therefore, the possibility for a blocked in condition of WBG2336 needed to be evaluated. The feed to WBG2336 was stopped by closing a manual valve (V1) in the Cumene Extraction Unit. After K23 had been emptied and the bottom pump was stopped, the manual valve (V2) at the discharge of the pump was closed. This isolated WBG2336 from the bottom of K23, but allowed for an opening at the outlet from WBG2336 to Tank 93. ; At this same time, the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 was also shut. Shortly after that, approximately 9 minutes, the operator realized that he had closed the wrong valve. At this point the operator opened the manual valve (V3) at the outlet of WBG2336 to K23 and closed the manual valve (V4) at the cold side inlet to WBG2336. ; A spike in the flow meter (FR82331) on the feed line to K23 provides an indication of this valve manipulation. Based on the short period of time of the blocked in condition and short duration of the associated flow spike, the pressure buildup was determined to be insufficient to cause damage to WBG2336. It was also determined that the severity of the damage to WBG2336 could not have been caused by thermal expansion. ; Therefore, this scenario was eliminated as a possible cause for the over pressurization of WBG2336.Spontaneous Decomposition of CHPDuring normal operation of K23, there is approximately 2% CHP in the feed to and bottom product from the column. Due to the highly reactive nature of CHP, the possibility of spontaneous decomposition needed to be evaluated. An analysis of the material from the bottom of K23 at 10.00 on April 9th showed that the CHP content was 1.43%, which was in line with expected values. An analysis of a sample from the feed line to WBG2336 following the incident indicated that the CHP content was 0.92%, which was slightly below the expected value. ; Based on testing it is known that even at a temperature of 140 °C, no instantaneous decomposition of 2% CHP would occur. In a weak acid system, pH &gt; 2, CHP would decompose mainly to DMPC and ACP through thermal decomposition. It would also decompose partially to phenol and acetone through acid catalyzed decomposition. Based on this information the spontaneous decomposition of CHP was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurization of WBG2336.MHP Decomposition to Hydrogen and OxygenDuring normal operation, there was approximately 0.2% MHP in the feed, 0.1% in the bottom product, and below 3% in the aqueous phase of K23's side draw. ; A partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. ; However, samples taken from the side draw receiver (BBG2305) and the overhead receiver (BBG2303) following the incident showed increased levels of MHP in both vessels. ; After the incident the MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 28 and 8 % respectively. The pH figures of both liquids were below 3. Although it was known that the feed to column K23 contained only small amounts of MHP, it was not known that MHP could be concentrated in localized areas. A literature review on this topic identified only one case where increased MHP concentrations were linked to an explosion in a process for making surfactants. Due to the lack of physical properties for MHP, this condition is difficult to model. However, after making certain assumptions, a simulation for the operation of K23 could be performed. The simulation indicated that MHP could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operation with a peak of around 7%. ; Obviously, as shown by the analysis of material in BBG2305 after the incident, the MHP was concentrated up to a much higher concentration. This was probably caused during specific shut down conditions at relatively high reflux ratios. The identified location of the MHP peak was between the top tray, where reflux is added to the column, and just above the side draw. Thus, the temperature profile and outlet configuration could allow for K23 to reach equilibrium with an area of localized high concentration of MHP in the top section and low concentrations in all of the outlet streams. K23 is designed so that all liquid contained above the side draw is directed to BBG2305. Therefore, when K23 is shut down and its contents are allowed to flow into the bottom, the concentrated MHP would flow into BBG2305 where it would be separated with the aqueous phase and be pumped to Tank 93. This condition is supported by the sample analysis from material in BBG2305 following the incident, which indicated MHP concentrations that were much higher than expected during normal operation. In addition to MHP the simulation showed a much lower peak for hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which was in the feed to the column, too. With a concentration of 20 wppm in the feed the estimated peak was 100 wppm besides the 7 % MHP. The H2O2 concentration in BBG2305 after the incident was determined to be 385 wppm besides 28 % MHP. As well as for MHP the calculated maximal concentration for H2O2 is lower than the analyzed figure, due to a probably higher accumulation during the shut down procedure. Normally, the cumene at the outlet of WBG2336 going to Tank 93 is at a temperature of 35 °C. ; However, after the feed to K23 was stopped, the temperature of WBG2336 increased to at least 128 °C. This is indicated on the temperature indicator at the outlet of WBG2336 to Tank 93. A review of the piping configuration indicated that in addition to being exposed to the hot cumene exiting WBG2336, the aqueous phase, due to a difference in density, could also migrate into the hot side of the heat exchanger. The bottom section of WBG2336's hot side could be filled with aqueous material by displacement of the hot cumene. This displacement is indicated by a temperature increase from 109 °C to 134 °C on temperature indicator TR82374. Similarly, the top section of WBG2336's hot side could accumulate a vapor phase that could be generated through the decomposition of MHP. Since the hot side of WBG2336 was not equipped with a vent line, this vapor phase would accumulate down to the side outlet of the heat exchanger from where it would then begin to flow into the transfer line to Tank 93. ; Based on mechanical drawings, it is estimated that the maximum volume of vapor that would accumulate in WBG2336 would be 175 liters. ; Following a discussion with specialists in the field of explosion testing, it is now known that vapor phases containing hydrogen concentrations in the range of 16% to 90%, with the remainder being composed of oxygen, could be ignited with minimal energy input and a detonation would occur. ; Under these conditions, even small explosive gas volumes could result in excessive localized pressure upon ignition. Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the formation of an explosive atmosphere with hydrogen and oxygen, resulting from the decomposition of MHP, needed to be evaluated, as the review of the system indicated no path for oxygen to enter the system from the atmosphere. The Limiting Oxygen Concentration (LOC) for hydrogen is 4.3 Vol% at normal conditions. Taking into account the higher temperature in the heat exchanger, the LOC was around 3.8 Vol%. A hydrogen containing gas atmosphere with more than 4 Vol % of hydrogen is only explosive if at the same time the oxygen concentration is above the LOC.Based on a few former investigations, it was known that MHP decomposes to hydrogen. The reaction is relatively fast at a high pH and low at a pH below 7. The reaction is enhanced by adding formaldehyde to the MHP containing solution, but again only hydrogen is formed. Oxygen could only be formed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide H2O2, which is present in the aqueous stream (2) from BBD0020. The concentration of ; H2O2 in the cumene stream (1), which was the feed to K23, was analyzed to be below 20 wppm. The H2O2 concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 were determined to be 385 and 50 wppm respectively, besides the much higher MHP concentrations of 28 % and 8 % respectively. Based on this a simultaneous formation of significant amounts of oxygen from H2O2 besides hydrogen formation from MHP was very unlikely. To verify the mechanism of hydrogen formation from MHP and to exclude a simultaneous formation of critical amounts of oxygen at low pH, several decomposition tests were made. The tests were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2), as well as with the liquid from BBG2305, taken after the incident. The tests were made in a special adiabatic calorimeter (Vent Sizing Package calorimeter VSP). Around 65 ml were filled in a 110 ml vessel, which was then closed and set under a slight vacuum. The vessel was heated until the thermal decomposition occurred and the content heated up itself under adiabatic conditions. The vessel was cooled down to around ambient temperature and a gas sample was taken. The analyzed gas concentrations were corrected to take into account preliminary air content from slight vacuum. At each test a double gas analysis was made. No peroxides could be analyzed from the remaining liquid, thus there was always a total decomposition. In addition to the gas analysis, such calorimetric tests deliver information about reaction heat and reaction dynamics, see chapter 4.4. In case of a very violent reaction (runaway) the VSP vessel bursts and the content is released to a secondary compartment, which is filled with nitrogen. Ten tests (run 1 to 10) were made.Runs 1 to 6 were made with the MHP and H2O2 containing stream (2) from the process, at different pH. In general, mainly hydrogen is formed in an amount of 25 to 35 ; mol% of the initial amount of MHP. That fits very well to the operational experience of Thermi I. The amount of oxygen varies with the pH. At a low pH, only 20 mol% in maximum of the H2O2 are converted to oxygen. That is not surprising, because in the presence of MHP, formaldehyde is formed which reacts with H2O2 to form hydrogen, too. In contrast, the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is around 100 % at a pH of 7. At a higher pH the formation of oxygen from H2O2 is again reduced. From these test runs a reaction heat of around 340 kJ per mol MHP could be determined. The activation energy of the decomposition reaction is around 120 kJ/mol. These figures indicate that the decomposition reaction is highly exothermic and increases rapidly with increasing temperature. The gas formation is around 12.4 ln (standard norm liter) per mol MHP. Runs 7 to 10 were made with the MHP containing stream from BBG2305. As already mentioned above, only small amounts of H2O2 (385 wppm) were in this stream. Run 7 was made with a diluted sample to be able to get gas samples. Unfortunately the gas analysis failed, but from the exothermic reaction a similar reaction heat was found, as in the tests before. Run 8 was made with a higher concentrated MHP solution of 15.8 %. The reaction behaviour of a solution with such a higher MHP concentration is also described in a Japanese paper. As expected, the calorimeter burst and the content was released into the secondary compartment. A gas sample could not be taken. The results from this test about reaction dynamics of such a higher concentrated MHP solution will be discussed in chapter 4.4. Runs 9 and 10 were made again with a lower concentrated solution to get reliable gas concentrations from the decomposition. Again it could be shown that mainly hydrogen is formed besides small and uncritical amounts of oxygen.For all tests an analyzed concentration of lower than 0.5 Vol% oxygen should be considered as an inaccuracy of taking and analyzing the gas samples. Significant higher concentrations could only be found from decomposition of solutions with significant amounts of H2O2, see runs 1 to 6. As only small amounts of H2O2 were present in the side stream from K23 besides a high concentration of MHP, the decomposition could only lead to low concentrations of oxygen, see runs 9 to 10. The decomposition of such a solution could not lead to an explosive gas atmosphere. The oxygen concentration would have been always below the Limiting Oxygen Concentration of 3.8 Vol%. Based on these results, the formation of an explosive gas atmosphere and a successive ignition was eliminated as a possible scenario for the over pressurisation of WBG2336. Nevertheless it will be recommended to develop guidelines for proper handling of liquids containing MHP and/or H2O2 to prevent any accumulation of flammable atmosphere.Spontaneous Decomposition of MHPAs stated in the previous section, normal MHP concentrations are relatively low throughout the system and a partial decomposition of MHP to methanol and hydrogen was expected in K23 based on operating experience. Samples taken from the system, following the incident indicated MHP concentrations in BBG2305 and BBG2303 as 28 and 8 % respectively. ; Due to the elevated level of MHP in the system, the spontaneous decomposition of MHP, leading to a thermal explosion, needed to be evaluated. ; A thermal explosion of a reactive liquid, what is also called a runaway reaction, leads to a temperature and pressure increase due to the heat and gas formation, all effects increasing exponentially with increasing temperature. As already described in the previous section, the MHP concentration in the column could be concentrated in the upper section of the column in the aqueous phase and remain there during normal operations. Therefore, when K23 was shut down, the concentrated MHP could flow into BBG2305 where it was separated with the aqueous phase and pumped to Tank 93. As described in the previous section, this aqueous material could migrate to WBG2336 and filled the bottom section of the exchanger's hot side after stopping the pump PBG2300. Based on the temperature indication at the outlet of the hot side, it is known that this area was at a temperature of at least 128 °C. ; At this temperature, it was known that MHP will thermally decompose. ; However, both the decomposition velocity, nor the amount of energy that would be generated by this elevated concentration of MHP, were not known yet. The test run 8, was made with a solution of 15.8 % MHP and took place under adiabatic conditions. The test showed a continuous increase of temperature up to 180°C and an increase of pressure because of gas formation. At this temperature, the pressure was around 20 bar and the vessel burst. From this test the kinetics of the MHP decomposition could be evaluated, which allows to calculate the temperature and pressure increase over time for adiabatic conditions and various conditions regarding MHP concentration and starting temperature. Based on the reaction heat of 340 kJ/mol, an aqueous solution would heat up with around 17°C per one percent decomposed MHP under adiabatic conditions. The Japanese paper, presents some results from decomposition tests of MHP solutions up to 16.3 %. A reaction heat of 341 kJ/mol MHP was found, what is very similar to the results from the own investigations. For the 16.3 % MHP solution a maximal heat rate of around 20°C per second is reported in the Japanese paper, what was the maximal detection rate in that test apparatus. From the experiment at Degussa with a 15.8% MHP solution a heat rate of 30°C per second was detected, just before the vessel burst at 180°C. Thus, for the same MHP concentration the decomposition rate of the side draw from K23 was similar or even higher than reported in the Japanese paper.  ;It is now very likely, that the following scenario happened: At around 13.28, when K23's bottom pump was stopped, the aqueous phase could flow into WBG2336 by displacing hot cumene. The aqueous phase from K23's side draw vessel BBG2305 had a temperature of around 70°C. Hot cumene was displaced and flowed to Tank 93, As already mentioned, this was indicated by the temperature increase from 109 °C to 134 °C by the indicator TR82374. After reaching this maximum at 13.39, the temperature dropped down to finally 106 °C at 14.00. In maximum, the lower part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger could be filled up with the aqueous phase, what was around 155 liters. By initial gas formation from MHP decomposition, hydrogen could accumulate in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger. The aqueous phase could heat up in contact with the hot cumene and the hot steel from the heat exchanger, as well as by MHP decomposition, until it started to boil. The pressure in the heat exchanger was around 0.7 barg, coming from the backpressure of Tank 93. The boiling point of pure water at this pressure is 115°C. But as the aqueous phase contained light boilers like MHP, acetone and methanol, the boiling point was lower, probably around 106°C, which was finally indicated by TR82374. First the vapor could accumulate, besides hydrogen, in the upper part of the hot side of the spiral heat exchanger and then had to release to the line towards Tank 93. The initial MHP concentration in the aqueous phase from BBG2305 was probably below 3 %, as it was from normal operation of K23. After the incident the MHP concentration in BBG2305 was 28 %. It is assumed, that the mean concentration in the heat exchanger was finally 15 %, what is approximately the average of these two figures. By evaporating, the heat from MHP decomposition could initially be discharged, until the thermal explosion occurred. Due to heat removal by evaporation at the beginning, the effective MHP concentration, which finally caused a thermal explosion, was lower. Nevertheless, the gas formation from 6 % MHP is already sufficient to exceed a pressure of 15 barg, what caused the failure of the heat exchanger. Form the kinetics a runaway of a 15 % MHP solution occurs within 100 seconds, starting at 106°C. At a temperature of more than 115°C, the pressure increase over time from gas formation is higher than 10 bars per second. Such a high pressure gradient could not be compensated by a release of the gas towards Tank 93, because the inertia of the liquid in the long pipe was too high. ; Consequently the heat exchanger burst, as it could not withstand a pressure of more than 15 barg. Based on these investigations, a thermal explosion (runaway) of a higher concentrated MHP solution is the cause for the over pressurisation of the spiral heat exchanger WBG2336.",runaway reaction,,"process analysis

45,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"The accident, its development and consequencesOn the 2nd of June 2006, an operator was killed by an explosion in a batch reactor. At the time of the accident, he was closing the manhole of the reactor after loading solid raw materials through the manhole. The manhole lid was blown off by the explosion in the reactor and hit the operator in the face. The operator died instantaneous. The manhole was found several meters from the reactor. The sprinklers in the production building were automatically activated by the fire in the reactor. Neighbouring equipment was slightly damaged due to projectiles from the explosion. The accident had no consequences for the environment or for the surroundings.Process descriptionThe reactor is the first step in the batch production of polyesteracrylates. In the reactor polyols are esterificated with acrylic acid. This endothermic reaction is operated at ambient pressure and at a temperature between 80°C and 120°C. The process exists of different consecutive steps in different equipment (reaction, washing, filtration, stripping and concentration) and needs many manual interventions by the operator. The installations are located in a closed building.The accident happened in the loading phase of the reactor, which consists of:- loading of liquid catalyst from an isobulkcontainer (IBC). It is sucked in the reactor by putting the reactor under vacuum. This is done manually at the reactor.- manual loading of small quantities of solid raw materials (prepared in buckets) through the manhole- loading of solvent (toluene) from the bulk tank (controlled by DCS)- loading of acrylic acid from a bulk storage tank (controlled by DCS).The reaction is controlled by the process computer (DCS) through the flow rate of acrylic acid and the temperature. The operator checks the pH of a sample of the reaction product to determine whether the reaction is completed. If so, the product is transferred to the wash vessel and the reactor is rinced with the solvent toluene, which is afterwards also added to the wash vessel. The reaction product and the wash toluene are transferred to the wash vessel using compressed air.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE"," ;Accident scenario &amp; causesTwo of the three components of the fire triangle were with certainty present at the time of the explosion:- OxygenThe process was operated in oxygen containing atmophere (ambient air). According to the company, in the initial design this was judged to be necessary to assure the acrylic acid inhibitor to inhibit the undesired autopolymerisation of the acid. - Flammable substanceThe reactor is washed with toluene between two batches. After the washing, there are still toluene vapours present in the reactor. Calculations performed by the company before the accident estimate the concentration of the toluene/air mixture at approx. 5 vol%. Given the explosion limits of toluene of 1,2 vol% and 7 vol% at ambient temperature, the reactor contained an explosive toluene/air mixture in the gas phase when the operator was manually loading raw materials through the open manhole. The ignition of the toluene/air mixture is most likely due to an unwanted chemical reaction between the raw materials that were loaded manually through the manhole of the reactor. Laboratorium tests performed during the accident investigation identified a reaction between three of the five manually loaded solids. The heat production rate is low at ambient temperature but raises rapidly from 70°C on. At 90-100°C, a violent exothermic reaction occurs with the production of carbon oxide, carbon dioxide and phosphine. Phosphine autoignites at 100°C. The explosion was most likely an explosion of the toluene/air mixture in the reactor, ignited by the auto-ignition of phosphine. Because the solid materials are added to a nearly empty reactor (contained only 100 liter of liquid catalyst), they could accumulate at the reactor wall below the manhole. This wall is supposed to have been at a temperature around 80°C, since the previous batch was stopped at 80°C and based on evidence that the cooling was not turned on before the operator started the loading of the next batch. This means that the reactor wall was at a temperature very close to the start of the runaway reaction between the solids.The company claims that the normal operation was to load one third of the solvent before the manual addition of the additives. This would have avoided the accumulation of the solids to the reactor wall and hence the runaway reaction igniting the toluene vapour.However the loading sequence was not clearly defined in the batch cards and instructions. Furthermore, the process computer software was not in accordance with the sequence supposed to be followed by the operators. During the last 15 years, several modifications were introduced (E.g. loading the solvent in two steps to avoid splashing when adding solid catalyst and raw materials, ; change from solid to liquid catalyst). As a consequence, operators often only launched the new batch on the process computer after having loaded the catalyst and the solid raw materials. Since the cooling of ; the reactor is only automatically activated by the DCS once the start of a new batch is launched on the process computer, this deviation in the loading procedure implied that the reactor was not cooled during manual loading unless the operator started the cooling manually. The normal sequence implies an exposure to toluene vapours when loading the raw materials during the manhole. This exposure issue was formally identified by the company in risk and work place studies since 2001. Operators were supposed to wear breathing protection masks, but this was not formally and strictly imposed nor supervised. Due to the lack of clear batch cards and instructions and the lack of supervision by management, the loading sequence differed from shift to shift and even between operators of the same shift. As for the sequence followed by the victim, some of the operators intended to avoid toluene exposure - and thus the need of wearing a breathing mask - by adding the toluene after all the manual loading via the manhole. The risk study on the process was incomplete:- not all process steps were addressed (E.g. toluene washing of the reactor between two batches)- the explosion risk was not adequatly evaluated (only measures to avoid ignition source, no question whether oxygen was really needed during the loading phase)- the loading sequence was not investigated (was supposed to be correct and followed in practice)- not all risks were identified (dangerous reactions between raw materials, use of compressed air for the transfer of solvents between vessels).An incident in July 2003 on a similar reactor indicated possible dangerous reactions between the solid raw materials. ; The follow up of the conclusions of the incident investigation was insufficient. A project aiming addition of all raw materials with closed systems (hoppers) and working in lean air conditions was planned for implementation later in 2006. The organisational changes within the company over the last years significant influenced the delay in taking technical improvement measures. The establishment changed of legal entity mid 2004 with a view of being taken over by a worldwide group, with a freezing of investments as a consequence. The take over in 2005 lead to significant changes on management level and staffing. ; The safety management system, which was in process of being adapted to the SMS guidelines of the new group who took over the company, did not assure an evaluation of the impact on safety of this kind of organisational changes.

Risk studies on batch processes should consider all process steps and conditions. Measures eliminating the existence of an explosive atmosphere should always have priority to measures preventing the ignition of that atmosphere.  
Loading of products through an open manhole into flammable atmosphere is not good practice.
Recommendations of risk studies and incident investigations need to be followed up systematically.
The safety responsibilities and duties of management should be clearly identified.
Work instructions should be clear and periodically reviewed and actualised. The process control system should correspond to the intended process method. 
All changes to the process and process working methods should be evaluated as to their impact on safety (management of change procedure). The management of change procedure should also address changes in organisational structure or in staff.Actions taken/imposed:
The lean air project was implemented before restartup of the production
lines. Other processes involving opening of manholes where identified
and were only accepted to start up again if no flammable substances
were involved. 
Raw materials are added via closed systems. Buckets are replaced by closed recipients. 
All process risk studies will be revised and completed within a short
time period. Priorities for the risk analysis program were made based
on hazard potential of the processes involved. 
The adaption process of the safety management system to the guidelines
of the new group is accelerated and expected to be complete before the
end of 2006, correcting at the same time the shortcomings identified in
the accident investigation. 
Management will be instructed on safety responsibilities and duties.

48,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"On Saturday January 5th 2008 a production operator discovered a fair-sized phenol leak in the phenol pump house next to the phenol storage tank. One of the gaskets on the flange connection on the outlet pipe of the tank had failed. The head of the operations department tried to stop the leak by tying a rubber belt around the flanges. In the meantime, an operator sprayed lots of water on the flange to avoid contact with phenol as much as possible.The phenol that had leaked was collected in the catchment pit of 20 m# underneath the pump house. Afterwards the spray water was added to it. This catchment pit had a high level alarm, but that was not functioning at the time of the leak. The malfunctioning was not known by the company at that time because the alarm wasn't inspected periodically. An attempt was made to close the only manual valve on the pipe, located between the inner and the outer tank shells. But the valve broke off during this manipulation. So the line couldn't be shut off. After the temporary repair of the flange connection, three trickles of phenol kept on spraying, which were also collected in the catchment tank. It wasn't allowed for the employees to enter the pump house for as long as the phenol was leaking.To clean up the catchment pit, the company disposes of a waste tank, which is big enough to contain all leaked and leaking phenol. When starting to pump the phenol from the catchment tank to the waste tank, it was discovered that the catchment pit did overflow. Part of the phenol/water mixture had flown over the rim of the open pit into the municipal sewer system. At the time, it was not yet known how much phenol had leaked to the sewer system.On Monday January 7th 2008 it was decided to start up the phenol based batch production to consume all phenol in the storage tank as the phenol tank had to be taken out of service in order to replace the gasket on the flange. On Tuesday January 8th, after a few batch productions, it was found out that the level indicator in the phenol storage tank got stuck since the last control of the level on Friday 4th (comparison of manual level measurement with level indicator). Only at that moment the company realised how much phenol had leaked out of the tank: about 25 tonnes! Most of it should have been collected in the catchment pit, so it was recuperated. But a part of the phenol, more than 5 tonnes, got in the municipal sewer. As far as is known, there was no external damage reported.A specialised company came on site to repair the (remaining) phenol leak with a temporary, but solid solution.

49,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"Tubular protector on the electrical cable for the submerged pump in tank No. 8 was damaged during pumping thereby leading to a release of liquid chlorine from the tank.On 21.7.2000 at 07:45 there was a release of chlorine to the atmosphere as a result of an operational accident involving the chlorine tank No. 8 (TK 2.01.C) in the chlorine store, building E 4990, in the electrolysis operations, PVC plant of the company. The release reached beyond the boundary of the company. At 07:56 h a level III chemical alarm was issued. The release from the tank was stopped before 17:00 h by the fire service in cooperation with workers from the electrolysis operation. During this time 12 members of HZS were treated medically, with 10 of these being injured (inhalation, acid burn). No other workers at the plant or inhabitants of the surrounding area were harmed. The accident had no affect on the operation of the production plants.On the 21.7.2000 at 7:00 Mr Majer prepared, on the request of the head of the chlorine filling shop. Mr. Juris, the pumping of chlorine from tank 8 located in building E 4990 to an external tank. After performing the necessary manipulation and checking the operational parameters of the tank he switched on the pump in tank 8. At that point he heard a loud bang, and saw that the store was inundated with chlorine, whereby he switched off the pump. On the basis of the reaction of sensor no. 5 of the emergency monitoring system (a signal is lead to the electrolysis control panel of the operational headquarters of the fire services) at 7:49, it is possible to estimate the time of accident as approx. 7:45. Obrat informoval Mr. Juris and together dressed in protective masks they investigated what had happened. Due to the heavy inundation of chlorine Mr. Juris returned to the adjacent building for breathing equipment. He then informed Mr. Kubist, manager of the chlorine, lye and ATA production, who at 7:52 called for the fire services (extension 150). After entering the inundated storage area, Mr. Juris attempted to determine the source of the leakage. He discovered that the liquid chlorine was leaking from the top of tank 8, where the pump was located. He supposed that the chlorine delivery route from the pump was broken, as the leak occurred at the moment the pump was turned on.In difficult conditions and with minimal visibility he closed the armature of the delivery pump above the lid of the tank and opened the armature of the deaeration tank to the chlorine production. He then left the storage area and switched off the storage area ventilation system. In the meantime, Mr. Kubista activated the emergency shutdown in the sodium chloride production hall. The fire services arrived at 7:55 am. A third degree chemical alarm was sounded at 7:56 am. At this time wind direction was 278° (westerly) and velocity was 0.5 m/s. The fire services began their investigation at 8:00 am and began to take action to limit the leakage of chlorine from the tank. At the same time, Mr. Stastny switched off the electricity in building E 4990. The tenzometric scales and pressure and temperature measurements of the chlorine tanks in the store ceased to operate. After the arrival of the fire services, Mr. Juris and Mr. Kubista briefed them on the severity of the situation and that the liquid chlorine is probably leaking from the pump's feed pipe in tank 8. In light of the fact that after closing the delivery vent of the pump the intensity of the leak did not decrease, they deduced that the pipe ruptured somewhere between the lid of the tank and the delivery armature, where there is a special steel profile.. The fire services managed, under conditions of very poor visibility and spraying liquid chlorine, to directly identify the leakage point. On the basis of the third degree chemical alarm and the information given by NES -OkU Melník, vyhlásil NES the warning signal ""Catastrophe"" and subsequently announced that there had been a release of chlorine at Spolena over the public relay system in the town of Tisice-Kozly at 8:32.

NAMED SUBSTANCE,"A physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. Failure of pump motor in the tank.The cause of the accident was a physical explosion in the electrical part of the pump due to a reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine, initiated by sepnutí of the electrical circuit.The explosion was preceded by penetration of liquid chlorine into the stator parts of the pump motor through a hole in the protective membrane of the stator with subsequent chemical degradation of the material and loss of the insulation properties of the conductors.A short-circuit occurred in the in the stator parts of the pump motor near the protective membrane, which was made of Hastelloa material, on the 20.7.2000, as a consequence of the loosening of several conductors, initiated by a chemical reaction with the chlorine. The protective membrane was exposed to high temperatures for a period of up to 12 seconds (time period until electrical protection reacted) and subsequently perforated. Then the electrical current was lost thereby shutting down the electrical protection. The reaction was subsequently inhibited by the impact of the presence of a large volume of liquid chlorine. Liquid chlorine entered the stator coil and protective tubing of the feed conductors through the perforation in the stator protective membrane.Due to the shutting down of the pump on the 21.7.2000 there was an electrical and temperature overload, caused by a spontaneous reaction between the copper conductors and the chlorine. The sharp increase in temperature and the subsequent pressure (approx. 70 - 100 MPa) caused the explosion. The speed of the explosion cancelled out the effectiveness of the electrical protection. The upper tube of the pump motor was lifted and with a slight delay caused a pressure shock and the energy of the released gaseous chlorine caused the horizontal parts of the tubing of the feed conductors to break. Analysis of the quality of the welded joint indicated a clean break, without material defect, fatigue or corrosive damage.This resulted in the ejection of the remains of this tubing with the terminal block on the profile support of the flooring below the tank.

51,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides","Explosion of an emergency tank when the unit was out of operation during winter (from 24.12.2002).The explosion occurred on the adiabatic production line of nitrobenzene during the time when the system was out of operation due to the cold. The site of the explosion was a storage tank, the purpose of which is a safety drainage of supporting medium from the production line. The storage tank contains two phases - acidic (that means sulphuric acid in the concentration of 70-80 %) and organic (nitrobenzene). Both phases normally contain dissolved nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene in concentrations of up to hundreds of mg/kg. The investigation found that the most probable course of events was as follows: The first factor was the climatic conditions, which lead to the freezing of the route of the waste condensate from the technological steam heating, followed by the penetration of the condensate from the overfilled condenser through the barometric closure into the drainage storage tank with the sulphuric acid. Here, as a consequence of the dissolving temperature on the interface of the acid and organic phase, the temperature gradually increased accompanied by other bypassing exothermic reactions (thermal decomposition of less stable nitrophenols and dinitrobenzene). These reactions increased the temperature on the interface up to the decomposition temperature of nitrobenzene. Thermal decomposition of nitrobenzene was accompanied by a rupture of the storage tank - explosion. An investigation team was appointed in accordance with the operational guidelines of BC MCHZ - Instruction M2 - 26150.doc ""Investigation of extraordinary events"". Results of the investigation are summarized in the report ""Accident of the adiabetic line of the production plant of nitrobenzene"" event.No.1/2003/VS3 from 27.1.2003. Following the comments to A1.Immediately after the explosion, the JHZS BC MCHZ arrived on the scene, followed by other components of IZS. At the same time, the instruction was issued to close the terminal of the rain collector that drains the water to the Odra (remote controlled armature). Information from other interested persons, including technical steps, followed in accordance with the internal emergency plan of BC MCHZ. The explosion of the storage tank in the bottom part of the steel panel construction of the adiabatic line caused damage to the technological constructions of the line in the floors above. There was no fire during the explosion and nobody was injured. The liquid content of the storage tank, partially also in the form of explosion products, was sent flying and most of the liquid phase landed in the retention tank under the line, while a small part fell on the consolidated road, and approx. 1m3 fell on the surrounding snow. The liquid phase froze on the road and snow, and it was possible to clean it up after mixing with sawdust. The contaminated material was deposited on a protected surface in the area BC MCHZ. At the same time an aerosol cloud composed from soot and fine drops of acids formed. Most of the aerosol sedimented in the inner part of the area, while a part was blown to the south and southwest of the plant. The aerosol also hit a high-tension cable- inlet insulators to BC MCHZ, and made them scintillate. They had to be cleaned, leading to a temporary cut in the supply of electricity. Debris was spread up to 90m with one piece (a tube) being found at a distance of 300 m - on the opposite bank of the Odra river. The pressure wave broke windows in the surroundings and damaged the guttering of roofs of the neighbouring objects.

60,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"​A major explosion and fire occurred at Esso’s Longford gas processing site in Victoria, Australia. Two employees were killed and eight others injured. During the morning of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump supplying heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due to an increase in flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the absorber. (The plant was complex and the hot oil pump was only one component involved in the accident process; why the pump shutdown is complicated and important.) A heat exchanger is a vessel that allows the transfer of heat from a hot stream to a cold stream, and so does not operate at a single temperature, but experiences a range of temperatures throughout the vessel. Temperatures throughout GP905 normally ranged from 60 °C to 230 °C (140 °F to 446 °F). Investigators estimated that, due to the failure of the lean oil pump, parts of GP905 experienced temperatures as low as −48 °C (−54 °F). Ice had formed on the unit, and it was decided to resume pumping heated lean oil in to thaw it. When the lean oil pump resumed operation, it pumped oil into the heat exchanger at 230 °C (446 °F)—the temperature differential caused a brittle fracture in the exchanger (GP905) at 12.26pm.
About 10 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon vapour were immediately vented from the rupture. A vapour cloud formed and drifted downwind. When it reached a set of heaters 170 metres away, it ignited. This caused a deflagration (a burning vapour cloud). The flame front burnt its way through the vapour cloud, without causing an explosion. When the flamefront reached the rupture in the heat exchanger, a fierce jet fire developed that lasted for two days.
The rupture of GP905 led to other releases and minor fires. The main fire was an intense jet fire emanating from GP905. There was no blast wave—the nearby control room was undamaged.

61,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"On September 29, 2012, an explosion occurred at the Nippon Shokubai Plant in Himeji, Hyogo Prefecture, Japan. The explosion and subsequent fire in an acrylic acid intermediate tank killed one person and injured 36. The high temperature section which was not effectively cooled was formed in the upper section of the liquid stored in V-3138 and remained stagnant for a significant period of time. This has resulted in DAA formation and increased the liquid temperature further with the heat of dimerization. Since then, the liquid temperature reached the temperature which started the polymerization reaction. With the heat of polymerization reaction, the temperature increased even further. This caused V-3138 content to boil and built up V-3138 pressure until V-3138 started to crack. V-3138 content started to leak from the cracks, which caused the pressure to drop drastically and BLEVE occurred thereafter. As a result, V-3138 ruptured, scattered content ignited and caused the fire.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,BLEVE (boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion),,,,,06. FLAMMABLE - note 3(a),"The investigation has concluded the following direct causes, which led into the explosion and fire of intermediate tank V-3138: Even though high temperature of rectifying column bottom liquid was building up inside V-3138, the fact that the circulation of Recycle to Top was not commissioned caused insufficient cooling to the tank liquid. This resulted in acrylic acid remaining stagnant for a significant period of time at high temperature. Although it was known to the company that DAA would form at a faster rate at high temperature, there was still insufficient recognition of the potential risk of heat of DAA formation which could increase the liquid temperature, and lead to this accident. Due to lack of thermometers and inadequate temperature monitoring, it was not possible to detect the abnormal condition until the polymerization proceeded. Failure in “Management of Change (MOC)” The rule of MOC was established in 2004 at this plant.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","The operating procedure in place for pouring substances into containers with a capacity of 1 ;000 ;litres or more required a check to be carried out on any incompatibility between the product to be transferred and any residue of the product previously held in the container.In order to ensure that a double check was done, the forklift driver responsible for moving the containers was to select the containers to be filled and provide them to the worker who, after repeating the check, would fill them.In the event that occurred, the required checks were carried out by a single worker whose duties were both forklift operator and warehouse operative (responsible both for moving containers within the plant and, where relevant, filling them). In error, hydrochloric acid began to be poured into a container that had previously held sodium chlorite, with residues estimated at approx. (&gt;=) 1.6 kg still being present.
It is believed that the chemical reaction which caused the explosion can be explained by hydrochloric acid mixing with sodium chlorite.The stoichiometry of the reaction between sodium chlorite and hydrochloric acid is as follows: 5NaClO2 + 4HCl -&gt; 4ClO2 + 5NaCl + 2H2O The reaction leads to the formation of ClO2 (chlorine dioxide) which, as indicated on the safety data sheet (SDS Code: 50084, ClorDisys Solutions, Inc.) can give rise, in the gaseous phase, to spontaneous explosive decomposition in concentrations exceeding 10% v/v (low-order explosion). At concentrations greater than or equal to 14% v/v, the decomposition can cause a violent reaction (source: OxyChem Basic Chemicals Technical Service).
The initial error allowed interaction between substances whose incompatibility was in fact known and indicated in the procedure. However, issues have come to light that may have contributed to the incorrect operation:

the procedure in place at the plant envisaged a double check on the container’s label (indicating the substance previously held in it) by the forklift driver when selecting the container to be filled and by the worker filling it; the injured worker may have felt that he had complied with the procedure since, as warehouse operative, he was responsible both for moving the containers within the plant (forklift driver) and for pouring the acid from the tanks into the containers;
the plant does not have procedures for organising the yard as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (particularly concerning those not to be re‑used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances;
the containers are re-used and the check on any residues and their actual nature do not appear to be done.

In fact, sodium chlorite is stored at the plant and on sold on to customers in the same containers in which it arrives at the plant, i.e. without any pouring.The container used in error was present on the vehicle used the previous day by the same worker and not unloaded, together with a second container that had previously been used for hydrochloric acid and which should have used for filling.There is thus also a problem in how the yard is organised as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (in particular as regards those not to be re-used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances.As regards the incompatibility between the substances sold and present in the plant (as indicated in the internal procedure), consideration should also be given to the need to check the containers to be used for pouring operations, e.g. to check: ;

the label identifying the substance previously present;
whether any residues are present;
the actual nature of the residues;
whether the container to be used needs to be cleaned.

At 9.30 a.m., a certified delivery driver drove into an industrial gas plant classified ‘Seveso lower-tier’. At 9.35 a.m., he rammed his light commercial vehicle into a covered warehouse used for filling pressure cylinders. The warehouse was storing 238 cylinders of acetone, butane and propane (flammable gases) each containing between 1 and 3 ;m³ of gas. Several cylinders exploded within a minute of the crash. Pieces of the front of the warehouse fell to the ground as the vehicle and several cylinders began to catch fire. ;
The site’s security alerted the firemen on duty at the nearby station, who arrived on site in less than 15 minutes. When searching the scene of the explosions, they found the delivery man opening by hand the valves of acetone cylinders stored in an open warehouse next door. The man would set fire to a cylinder and move on to the next one. One of the firemen rushed towards the man and managed to restrain him. ; His arm was slightly injured in the process. The firemen extinguished the burning cylinders and then stopped the leaks while the police secured the industrial area. The employees were evacuated, 6 complaining of headaches and slight hearing loss. The employees of nearby companies were told to stay indoors. A body without a head was found inside the damaged commercial vehicle. The decapitated head of a man was found when the gendarmes searched the site.

The storage room takes up half of a building, with the other half being used for prototype construction. The front of the storage room consisted of double steel doors with large glass window panes. The back of the room consisted of glass bricks on the upper third. The other walls were solid walls with no windows.
There were steel cabinets along one wall, the first of which, nearest the door, was used as a chemical cabinet with forced ventilation for the storage of small quantities of e.g. solvent-based cleaning agents, adhesives and other auxiliaries. There were open steel shelves opposite the cabinets.
No explosives were stored in the room in accordance with the operating instructions. It was only used for material storage during the working day.

The operating instructions for hazardous substance cabinets have been revised.
The main points are:- Contaminated containers must not be used;- Solvents/chemicals must be stored only in tightly sealed containers;- Ventilation grills on the hazardous substance cabinets must not be blocked;- Use drip trays made of non-combustible material under containers;- Packaging (cardboard, film) must not be stored in the hazardous substance cabinet as they constitute fire loads;- Monthly operational testing of extraction inside the cabinets. ;

Process/sequence of events
Steam enters the shell through a side nozzle just behind the tube sheet. An impact plate is fitted to prevent the steam from hitting the bundle directly.
The damage consisted in a tube wall being punctured on the outlet side of the oleum. The formation of sulphuric acid when the leaking oleum came into contact with the heating steam then caused local corrosion of the non-alloy steel shell, allowing the oleum to escape into the environment.

The column is filled via the start-up pipe and the pipes are run dry. After the start-up procedure, the pipe remains closed on one side and filled with vacuum distillate (dead end). It is closed at the connection to the delivery side of the feed pump and is subjected to two-phase heating from below by means of steam tracing. The vacuum distillate in the pipe contains approximately 2 per cent by weight sulfur. The pipeline was opened on the delivery side of the bottom pump, where there are fluid temperatures of around 350 ;°C.
The damage to the pipe is due to high-temperature sulfur corrosion. The presence of sulfur and temperatures above 260 ;°C are necessary for this process.
The damaged area is located approximately 30 ;m downstream of the operating path from the bottom pump to a heat exchanger. The following are to be considered very likely causes:
- H2S introduced by the effect of thermosiphoning.- Leaking gate valve on the cold side (feed pump) causing sulfurous product to enter at &gt; ;260 ;°C.

There was a loud noise due to both the hole and the pressure of about 3.0 bar in the hot blast collecting pipe. Since the pipe is lined with refractory bricks, bricks were ejected from the damaged part of the pipe.The blast furnace was immediately shut down and made safe. The site of the incident was cooled by the plant fire service. The fire brigade was alerted and was on site.No one was injured. At no time was there any risk to the environment around the smelting works.Since the blast furnace was shut down at short notice, it could not be prepared for start-up, as normally happens in the case of scheduled shutdown procedures. When a scheduled shutdown of a blast furnace is performed, a ‘damping batch’ (increased coke rate) is introduced into the furnace about eight hours before the stoppage, which compensates for the energy lost during start-up.Because there was no damping batch and heat was lost during the five or so days when the furnace was shut down to repair the damaged area, the batch became caked and it was difficult to pass gas through the batch column in order to start up the blast furnace.After being repaired, the blast furnace was put back into operation at around 6.00 a.m. on 16 ;August 2013.

The tap holes are pressure safety valves pursuant to professional standard BGV C20 in the upper part of the blast furnace.Dust and blast furnace gas were released during the ‘blow-through’. ;
There are a total of four tap hole valves (pressure relief valves) on the blast furnace gas pipeline. The valves serve as a safety device to prevent excess pressure.

Emergency Response"," In order to prevent similar accidents, the investigation team recommends
the following measures. The recommendations are general,
concerning the entire industry.  Equipment
that have been added to ensure the safety of the process must be placed so that
their visual inspection and maintenance can be performed safely. Safety equipment
and devices should preferably have appropriate indicators or be connected to
the automation system so that their actuation can be detected.The
reasons for the actuation of the safety devices/equipment must be identified.
Running the production against the safety controls must not be accepted as a
normal procedure. The risks
related to the aging of equipment must be assessed. Special attention must be paid
to process safety critical devices and their preventive maintenance, condition
inspections and need for renewal. ; ; The operator
must ensure that the workers are aware of the hazards of different tasks and
work areas as well as the related safety and work instructions. The
instructions must include procedures on how to bring the process back into a
safe state after a fault situation. Management must go through the essential
safety instructions with the workers and supervise that instructions are
followed. Adequate
communication between shifts must be ensured. Appropriate shift change and
communication methods must be defined for operator-based maintenance workers.Operator-based
maintenance workers must receive sufficient guidance concerning the work area
and the tasks, including related hazards, before starting the work. Liabilities
and obligations concerning activities performed after fault situations
(including shutdowns and startups) must be clearly defined. Management of change must also include
the assessment of the safety effects of smaller changes. The up-to-dateness of
risk analyses, instructions and P&amp;ID must be checked regularly. The maintenance responsibilities for
installations that are situated across several departments and units must be
clearly defined.Also when handling and storing chemicals that
are formed during the production process, regulations and guidance concerning
the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals must be followed.  Internal
audits and inspections must also take into account the failure mechanisms of process
safety critical systems as well as procedures for corrective actions concerning
fault situations, including the responsibilities and tasks of the operating and
maintenance staff.New in Tukes: A short video ""What was learnt"" in Finnish. We have prepared also a slide show and a bulletin.

96,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"Pressure increased in an intermediate bulk container (IBC) and hydrogen chloride gas was released.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","The mixture of 3-chloro-o-xylene and phosphoryl chloride in the IBCs came from the site’s vacuum unit, where 3-chloro-o-xylene is used as ring water. Over time, this becomes enriched with phosphoryl chloride and is replaced at regular intervals. The only explanation for the intense gas build-up observed is hydrolysis of the phosphoryl chloride with water or alcohols.
An inspection of the substances handled at the facility found that, irrespective of the product/formula, there was no sign of any other critical interactions/reactions. This also applied to the case of cross-contamination between formulae. An inspection for potential water contamination in the ring water found the following possibilities:

Leakage into the heat exchanger, which is operated using cooling water;
Reverse flow of moisture from the waste gas collection system;
Insufficient emptying of residues from the IBCs.

Re 1: Apart from the cooling liquid in the heat exchanger, no water or alcohol is handled at the facility. An inspection of the heat exchanger found increased roughness on the upper surface, but no leaks were detected during pressure testing.
It must also be assumed that, in the event of a small leak in the heat exchanger, the small current of escaping water would react in the liquid-ring pump. The resulting HCl gases would be removed via the exhaust system, and would therefore not lead to an increase in pressure.
Re 2: The waste gas collection system is decoupled from the facility by a non-return valve. An inspection of the valve found no defects. Also, the limited amount of moisture expected in this event is considered to be insufficient to produce the amount of gas observed. It must also be assumed that in such an event, the moisture would react in the liquid-ring pump. The resulting HCl gases would be removed via the exhaust system, and would therefore not lead to an increase in pressure.
Re 3: Once the IBCs have been emptied of residues, they are visually inspected for any remaining liquid before being made available. Despite this visual inspection, however, liquid residue may still be present. Even small amounts of water (e.g. 10 ;l) cause a considerable build-up and release of HCl gas (e.g. 10 ;m3), which can compromise the integrity of the IBCs.
Before the incident, the ring water had most recently been purged and collected in three IBCs on 5 ;December ;2015. As the hydrolysis delivery pump was malfunctioning on 5 ;December ;2015, the phosphoryl chloride in the ring water could not be promptly hydrolysed or destroyed, and the IBCs had to be stored temporarily. On that day, one of the three IBCs was emitting HCl, for which the on-site fire service was called and the HCl that had escaped was immediately successfully suppressed with water curtains. For this reason, the IBCs were stored in the chlorine tank wagon shed. From there, on 17 ;December ;2015 the IBCs were returned to the chlorination building to be prepared for destruction. By 17 ;December ;2015, no critical situation had occurred in the other two IBCs, which is perhaps due to the fact that, up to that point, the IBCs had experienced only the slow formation of a two-phase system, resulting in a slow reaction only at the phase threshold, or that only a small quantity of water was present in these IBCs. As the IBCs were closed during transportation to the chlorine tank wagon shed, and were otherwise stored there with only a lid placed on top, the HCl gases that were most likely already being released were able to escape via the lid due to the slow speed of the reaction. Therefore, no critical build-up of pressure was observed.
Only when the IBCs were closed or insufficiently opened when transported back for hydrolysis in the chlorination building was it possible that the HCl gases being created could no longer escape, which must have led to the build-up in pressure in the IBCs in the chlorination building. Furthermore, transportation may have led to an increase in the phase threshold, resulting in an increased rate of gas release. This caused the loss of integrity of the IBCs associated with the release of HCl gas, as observed on 18 ;December ;2015. Up until the day of the incident, the aforementioned mixture was handled openly and sent for correct disposal. The procedure has since been changed.","vessel/container/containment-equipment failure

97,Major Accident,"Processing of ferrous metals (foundries, smelting, etc.)","On 15 ;April ;2016 at 20.53, a jet fire occurred in a blow mould of a blast furnace. As a result of this incident, approximately 30 ;t of coke were ejected.The resulting fire was swiftly brought under control by the on-site fire service with support from the fire brigade.The blast furnace was quickly put in a safe state. In particular, this involves cutting the blast furnace off from the gas network and bringing the cooling system into operation (emergency diesel). In general, jet fires can have two different causes:Failure of the jet tip’s fireproof material:The hot blast (approx. 1 ;200 ;°C) burns through the jet’s steel casing.In this event, a whistling noise is perceived before material is ejected.Mechanical strain on the blow mould:Formations (iron, burden) inside slide down the furnace wall and can lead to an impact on the blow moulds. This can result in a significant crack occurring at the site of the jet tip in the blow mould, through which a hot blast can escape. In extreme cases, the blow mould can be sucked inside the furnace. In this event, the jet and/or the blow mould spontaneously fails and material is ejected. Effects of the incident:No one was injured. The blast furnace was damaged, particularly in the cable runs and switch units affected by the fire.Furnace gas escaped through the opening in the furnace around the blow mould’s jet and, due to the surrounding conditions (hot gas, red-hot coke, influx of hot air) immediately combusted.The fire caused further visible emissions, largely due to the coke fire and water vapour during firefighting efforts. The smoke cloud drifted towards the river Rhine / Rheinhausen.The water used to extinguish the fire is not thought to have been contaminated with pollutants, as the water was largely used to cool the escaping coke and the parts of the facility.The water ended up on the floor of the smelting works, and from there flowed into the Rhine via the normal drainage system, which is fitted with oil separators.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,not known / not applicable,,,,,,,00.

This led, amongst other things, to the failure of the cooling brine pumps and the HF cooling machines. The duty electrician was sent for immediately afterwards. The lack of cooling and the pressure build-up in the whole system led to a visible emission of CaSO4/H2SO4/HF from the two rotary kilns a few minutes later.This was stopped by opening the emergency extraction system immediately. Due to the lack of cooling capacity, the liquid HF evaporated in the condensers. The resulting large quantity of gas was drawn into the kilns as a result of the emergency extraction and then escaped at the kilns’ sealing points. The raw materials feed was then shut off. In parallel, the brine pump was manually started, but in spite of the electrical starting pulse being given, this pump did not start. The cooling machines were then able to be started with the help of the electrician. At that time (15:30), emissions were already starting to fall due to the feed of raw materials being halted.As the brine pump was not running, the cooling machines failed again due to unused cooling capacity. At that time it was noticed that the brine pump was not running; this was then successfully started.

111,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"On 6 September 2016 an automatic system opened safety valves (‘bleeders’) at a blast furnace at around 20:27 for a period of approximately 4 minutes. The bleeders are located on a 86 ;m platform and are the safety devices provided for in the blast furnace as described in the Partial Safety Report, which prevent and safely release an unacceptable overpressure in the blast furnace. This measure resulted in an emission perceptible from outside the factory (discharge of dusty blast furnace gas with audible flow noise).
Safety measure:Due to an as yet unidentified error within the redundant programmable memory controller (SPS) of the pressure measurement in the blast furnace’s risers, there was a fault in the process control system, which resulted in a system reset for pressure measurements being carried out in the measurement system. The previous fault had reduced the counter-pressure on the blast furnace to around 1 bar. The set point was 2.4 bar. As a result of this very large system deviation, the annular scrubber units in the gas purification process slammed shut. As a result, pressure built up in the upper furnace and the built-in safety features were triggered in the correct order:

The Snort Valve opened several times to reduce wind pressure.
The first bleeder opened when a pressure of approximately 3.1 bar was reached.
The opening of the bleeder released the furnace pressure safely into the atmosphere as expected.
The triggering of this safety system eliminates a serious risk for staff and local residents. When the bleeders closed at 20.31, the furnace pressure was again in the controlled range and the system was again in normal condition.

The reason for failure is, in the expert’s view, accidental errors.",not identified,,,,,Causes - Plant/Equipment,"In particular, in comparable situations in future, the existing back-up system will be used until the SPS becomes available again after a restart. This has already been achieved by implementing an automatic switch to the back-up controller (with appropriate visualisation) in the event of an error in the standard system as an ad hoc measure. ;
During planned standstills in summer 2017, two additional pressure transmitters will be installed on the blast furnace gas risers. Their analogue readings will then be transmitted directly to the back-up controller as a 4-20 mA signal. The back-pressure can thus be controlled by the back-up controller independently of the SPS on the basis of separate measurements of the pressure in the risers.
The analogue data signals from the four existing pressure transmitters on the risers will also be routed via four independent isolation amplifiers in order to decouple the signals."

Safety measure:As the start of the process was supervised from the control room and by an on-site staff member, the leak was noticed immediately and the pump stopped.

The route followed by the forklift was on a slope. A package appears to have fallen and been run over by the wheels of the forklift. There was then a friction/hotspot effect on the pyrotechnic substance that had spilled on the floor. This is based on the fact that the fork became detached from the forklift and the vehicle’s wheels were torn off and blown outwards around 20 ;m on each side. This configuration indicates that the initial load affected was probably under the forklift and that the explosion spread to the main load on the pallet.
Several other theories such as the pyrotechnic substance being unstable, pyrotechnic material leaking following a quality fault in a maroon, etc. have been discounted. Indeed, maroons from the same batch have been examined by experts without any anomaly in terms of stability or conformity being revealed. The products, which were manufactured by a Portuguese company, had been delivered the previous day to another site managed by the operator and then transferred that morning, for storage, to the site where the accident occurred. The operator had been working with that manufacturer for around 10 years. However, this was the first time it had ordered 75 mm maroons of this type.",,,,,,"Causes - Human

The loss of flow in the pipe occurred because of a compressor becoming blocked and a second compressor reducing to minimal flow.The fire then caused some other components in the facility to rupture, leading to a partial release of hydrocarbons. This was also the result of the malfunctioning of a cut-off valve when operated manually, probably because of a power cut owing to the power supply panel being affected by the fire.There was also a fire near the air coolers that broke out when the facility was depressurised rapidly because of stresses in excess of those designed for.","component/machinery failure/malfunction

The fire brigade’s investigation revealed that this was a DN 50 pipeline containing trichlorosilane.The pipeline was decompressed and shut off by the supplier. Due to the length of the pipe bridge and the distances between the shut-off valves, a large residual volume remained in the piping.Loudspeaker announcements were immediately made in parts of the plant instructing people not to leave or enter buildings (gas alarm).Measurements from the measurement bus, which was immediately deployed, showed no elevated values, neither for hydrogen chloride nor for other substances. The fire brigade used turbo extinguishers to precipitate the gas cloud; this was very successful.
However, the gas alarm was maintained as a precaution until the fire brigade had given its final report back on the closed-off pipeline.

During the leak, the measuring station could not ascertain quickly enough exactly which operational unit the pipe bridge in question belonged to. This caused a delay in shutting down the pumps and pressure lines, which allowed the release of trichlorosilane to continue.In order to allow for a faster shut down and flushing of bridge pipelines, an emergency plan (with exact location and layout of the pipe’s valves and facilities for flushing it) for each bridge pipeline with critical content will be drawn up by the relevant operators by March 2018 and included in the operating instructions. In addition, the internal instructions for pipeline bridges will be revised by the end of 2017.In order to ensure that the relevant measuring station can be quickly identified in the event of leaks, the specialist unit for pipe bridges is to affix a colour mark every 50 ;m on pipe bridges in the accessible area and label the pipe bridge supports with the pipeline bridge section number by June 2018.Operators are urged to mark the piping with the telephone number of the measuring station. The accuracy and legibility of these markings should be checked during regular inspections.In order to ensure that the pipe bridge data are up-to-date, they are to be imported into the computer system and maintained.


As the event took place in a place particularly affected by corrosion (salt discharge), the plant was examined for further hot spots.In these areas identified as particularly at risk, the firm’s corrosion protection department will carry out comprehensive external checks of the pipes by June 2018. Any deficiencies found will be corrected accordingly.In order to avoid secondary corrosion, old systems that are no longer in use are to be dismantled. If a pipe is to be maintained for subsequent return to service, it is to be treated as an active pipe and must be maintained and marked accordingly.


The quality of corrosion protection will be improved.For example, the removal of rust during maintenance is no longer to be carried out by hand, but by sandblasting. In addition, a partner company is to give confirmation that repairs in critical areas have been carried out properly.The operating engineers have been asked to ensure that works commissioned comply with the plant standards for corrosion protection.In addition, shift staff carrying out inspections are being made aware of the issue of corrosion.

The Government of Upper Bavaria – Labour Inspectorate has also called for a ‘shortening of inspection intervals for pipelines in “hot spot” areas (i.e. areas identified as particularly at risk).’
The lessons learned highlight the importance of operational monitoring procedures (in particular with regard to corrosion, maintenance, alarm management) and emergency planning procedures."

139,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"
Shortly after 6pm, on 2 June 2011, an atmospheric storage tank within the amine regeneration unit at the Refinery exploded. A fireball split the tank open and killed four workers. One survivor sustained severe burns and suffered life-changing injuries.
The force of the explosion ejected the five-tonne steel tank roof over 55 metres through the air. After narrowly missing a multi-fuel pipe track, the roof crashed onto a pressurised storage sphere containing extremely flammable butane. Good fortune prevented the airborne roof from puncturing the butane storage vessel, which would have led to an uncontrolled release of liquified petroleum gas (LPG).
The explosion was caused by the unintended ignition of a flammable atmosphere within the tank (17T302), during what should have been a routine cleaning operation conducted in preparation for maintenance.
The investigation revealed a longstanding and widespread failure to understand and control risks posed by the flammable atmosphere inside the tank. The explosion and the resulting fatalities were therefore avoidable. The incident was not merely the consequence of errors by individual employees, but because of the failure of safety management systems to ensure a safe place and safe systems of work.

 ;Lack of knowledge regarding light hydrocarbons in tank 17T302
The Refinery possessed information relating to the contamination of the ARU running tank with light hydrocarbon. However, key Chevron personnel, some of them senior, were not aware of this fact or the magnitude of contamination. For example, the procedure entitled ‘Action to take on LPG getting in to the ARU/SRU Flare Drum’, designed to prevent LPG entering the running tank, was not fit for purpose and routinely ignored.
Inadequate risk review
Following the decision in 1998 to operate the ARU as a closed system, there were a number of events that should have triggered a review of the unit risk assessment, in particular the need for repeated removal of excess light hydrocarbon material that had accumulated within the running tank. At no time did this repeated accumulation of material trigger an investigation into the cause, including sampling and analysis of the excess hydrocarbon material removed.
The application of site-wide procedures, for example for hazardous area classification (HAC), should have, but did not, identify the risk of a flammable atmosphere within the running tank.No safe system of work
The work carried out was not based upon a formal procedure or work instruction, which itself should have been developed based upon a suitable and sufficient risk assessment, industry guidance (for example the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice, Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code) and DSEAR regulatory requirements.
Significantly, the risks posed by two potential ignition sources (electrostatic spark and self-ignition of pyrophoric material) were not fully appreciated or controlled. ;

HSE believes that the deaths were preventable. The fact that the tank contained flammable material emerged several times, but the Operator did not take the opportunity to train staff and update their systems. Any change of plant operation should be critically risk assessed, adequately controlled and relevant systems updated accordingly, to ensure the significance of a newly generated hazard is not lost over time. This is particularly important where hazardous waste streams are recycled back into the process.
Other opportunities to prevent the explosion were also missed. Two days before the incident, a gas test indicated a potentially explosive atmosphere within the tank, but this information was either not shared or acted upon by those planning or carrying out the job. Companies should reflect upon this failure and review their own systems to ensure that they provide training and arrangements for the recording and communication of important safety-critical information.
This incident clearly demonstrates that safety management systems are only effective when robustly audited, monitored and enforced. Safety arrangements that have been allowed to degrade over time become weak and ineffective. Whilst providing an illusion of safety and risk control, as seen in this case, ineffective systems do not remain strong enough to prevent real harm occurring. This prosecution serves as a reminder to those with a responsibility for employees and contractors to actively monitor their safety management system arrangements and ensure they are effective in keeping workers safe.
Broader lessons
The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.
A risk assessment and the establishment of clear work instructions for any tank cleaning operation should be conducted by trained and competent staff.
To organise the work as safely as possible, the planning and preparation work should be based on knowledge of the hazardous tank contents, combined with a good understanding of and adherence to the published HSE guidance and specific tank cleaning standards, for example the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code.
HSE believe there are some clear lessons to be learned for all businesses in relation to safety management systems. Our recommendations are set out below.
1. ; Process safety performance indicators
Effective management of major hazards requires a proactive approach to risk management. Information to confirm that critical systems are operating as intended is essential. Carefully chosen process safety performance indicators can monitor the status of key systems, providing assurance that major hazard risks are under control or an early warning, should controls deteriorate. HSE publication HSG254 Developing process safety indicators: A step-by-step guide for chemical and major hazard industries contains practical information.
2. Process modification and the management of change
Process modifications, in this case converting the ARU from an open to a closed system, should not be undertaken without having carried out a safety, engineering and technical review. Risk assessment should then identify what hazards have been created by the change that may affect plant or personnel safety, and what action can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the risk.
Changes may affect other parts of the plant which may be remote from the source of the change. Therefore, all parts of the plant should be considered in undertaking hazard identification and risk assessments. Additional hazards that may be introduced which need to be considered include fire, explosion and loss of containment. Further guidance can be found within HSE publication L111 The Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 2015: Guidance on Regulations.
3. Safety-critical communications
A communications protocol should be developed and embedded within the workplace for the transmission of safety-critical information. In this case the %LEL reading that was taken from the top of the tank on 31 May 2011. For effective communication, information to be shared should be conveyed through more than one medium, for example oral and written, combined with clarification and confirmation offered by the recipient. Clearly this relies upon employers ensuring that those involved in a task understand what constitutes safety-critical information. HSE publication HSG48 Reducing error and influencing behaviour contains relevant guidance.
4. Competence management systems
Hazard identification, risk assessments and risk controls are all essential elements in ensuring that effective workplace precautions are implemented. Systems need to be in place to ensure that those carrying out these tasks are trained and competent, and that their work is monitored by competent managers.
Employers should ensure that an effective competence management system is in place, so that staff are adequately trained and competent to undertake the tasks for which they are responsible. This should include arrangements for limiting staff engagement in complex safety-critical activities, when deputising for senior colleagues. The Office of Rail and Road publication Developing and maintaining staff competence provides useful guidance.
5. ; Management of contractors
The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.
Companies engaged in the use of contractors should assume the role of an ‘intelligent customer’, rather than relying solely upon the contractor’s knowledge and experience. An intelligent customer will establish the regulatory and industry standards to which the contractor is expected to conform. The company will use this information to supervise the contractor’s performance and verify the adequacy of work carried out on its behalf. The Office of Nuclear Regulation guide Licensee Core Safety and Intelligent Customer Capabilities provides useful information.
6. ; Contractor competence
Contracting companies should understand HSE legislation, guidance and industrial standards relevant to their work activities. Technical requirements associated with topic-specific guidance, such as tank cleaning, should form a critical part of safety management systems. This is particularly important in relation to risk assessment, established systems of work, the procurement of work equipment, training and competence assessment.

This pipe is part of the high-pressure section of the urea plant, but no urea flows through it when the system is operating normally (dead branch).  The incident was caused by a corrosion mechanism which, due to the prevailing temperature gradient, led to an unexpectedly high degree of abrasion. It should be noted here that, in the context of work carried out while the system was out of operation in 2010, the main pipe was pressure-tested with 1.3 times the system pressure and the wall thickness was measured, with no abnormalities being detected in either case.

He immediately alerted the fire brigade which, after a few minutes on site with fire engines and turbo extinguishers, had the fire under control and then cooled the adjacent parts of the plant. The plant was automatically shut down as a result of the reduction in pressure of the oxygen. The dynamics of the shut-down operation resulted in flares becoming extinguished. The fire also caused a partial failure of the supply of control air. It was not possible to re-ignite the flares until that failure had been rectified, and approx. 1 000 kg of unburned naphthalene was emitted.At 9.55 a.m. on 30 May 2011, there was a fire in an oxygen compressor in an acetylene plant.
A member of staff discovered the fire as a result of the formation of smoke. He immediately alerted the fire brigade, which, after a few minutes on site with fire engines and turbo extinguishers, had the fire under control and then cooled the adjacent parts of the plant.
The fire was extinguished and the subsequent cooling measures were completed by 10.44 a.m.
The plant was automatically shut down. Cabling running above the compressor was damaged in the fire. This led, among other things, to a failure in the supply of control air from two flares and prevented the flares from being ignited. This failure caused up to approximately 600 kg of crude naphthalene to be released, unburnt by the damaged flares, between 10.37 a.m. and 2.59 p.m.
There was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages are concentrated in the area of the oxygen compressor and other technical equipment located in the area affected by the fire.

It is therefore obvious that a foreign body had entered the machine and triggered the incident.",other,,,,,Causes - Organisational,"- All trapping sieves were removed and checked for particles and damage. The inlet pipes were also checked for loose parts at the access points to the oxygen blowers.
- Energy pipelines and signal lines damaged in the fire were removed from the critical areas that would be affected by a similar incident.
- In addition to the cut-offs that had already been installed (pressure cut-off inlet low/outlet high, bearing lubricant oil temperature high/oil pressure low, axial thrust high), a temperature monitor has been fitted to the fire/noise protection casing of the blower, with an alarm in the measuring station, in order to be able to detect an increase in temperature even earlier, if necessary.
- There are important supply lines in the area of the blowers. A sprinkler system will be installed there as soon as possible in order to be able to provide intensive cooling in a short space of time. Water is supplied both by means of a fixed pipeline (deionised water network) and by means of a water hydrant, which can be connected by the fire brigade in an emergency.
- The safe operation of the flares was discussed in detail with the operator. In order to optimise ignition of the burners, a trial is being carried out on one acetylene flare and one lean gas flare in which conventional ignition is replaced by self-priming, electric ignition that does not rely on compressed air. If successful, the cracked gas flares will be retrofitted with this system."

Emergency Response","It should be noted that the event occurred in a part of the plant in which the operator, according to the assessments included in the ‘Information sheet for the general public and workers on the risks of a major accident’, had not anticipated any problems. It should further be noted that the substance processed in the area where the accident happened is not listed in Annex I to the Directive. The analysis of the information collected showed that the accident was possible and identifiable. In fact, explosions of combustible dust are events that have been widely studied and consequently the conditions in which they are liable occur have been officially identified. It is therefore possible to foresee the effects of a potential dust explosion and put specific measures in place to prevent both the formation of clouds of suspended dust particles, and the formation and presence of an active source of ignition. In the light of such considerations, work involving the use of combustible powders should have been included in the ‘Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents’. The only major accident risk envisaged in that report appears to be that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14 bar) at a distance of up to 173 m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07 bar) at up to 281 m and cause reversible injuries (0.03 bar) at up to 533 m.  The plant’s Safety Management System was reviewed in 2008, 2009 and 2011.
The 2011 review noted that the plant operator, in response to the irregularities detected previously in 2008 and 2009, drew up and established its own Safety Management System that was sufficient to meet the legal requirements. A subsequent on-the-spot check in 2013 showed that the latest instructions had been acted upon and that the operator had taken care to update the Internal Emergency Plan prompted by changes to the company’s organisation chart. The decision to merge the Safety Management System (SMS) (based on the previous technical legislation) with an Occupational health &amp; safety management system (OHSMS) (based on international standard OHSAS 18001) clearly demonstrates the operator’s intention to implement an overall improvement of the Plan."

To enable this, the plant has been cordoned off. According to the information received from the competent rescue units of the fire brigade, ‘based on information obtained immediately after the event, it appears that work was taking place in the area housing the hydraulic press when the explosion took place, and a van was parked in the area opposite, presumably loaded with fireworks — it was completely destroyed in the accident’. According to the legal representative of the plant operator, with input from the expert witness, the explosion may have been caused by a spark generated by a discharge of electrostatic energy that had built up on a worker’s clothing or on bags containing the raw materials awaiting processing in the hydraulic press area. It is argued that, given the fact that the accident took place at 13:40 in the month of July, the weather conditions (high temperature, low humidity) may have contributed to this accumulation of electrostatic energy. ; The plant’s representative has also stated that the surveillance footage from within the establishment shows that the first explosion took place in building C (workshop and hydraulic press) and that burning fragments (from finished fireworks present in the area) were launched in the direction of the other buildings reachable in a straight line from building C, causing a domino effect. The roofs of the affected buildings, which, in accordance with applicable legislation, had been designed to channel the force of the blast upwards in the event of an explosion inside, would not have been capable of protecting the products within those buildings from the impact of those burning fragments. The role, if any, of the van found destroyed in the area facing building C (figures 4 and 5 in the Confidential section) remains unclear, though it is ‘very likely that it was directly affected by the explosion, since it marked one of the points of the crater and had been completely blown apart by the blast’ (fire brigade report of 10 ;July 2014).",,,,,The procedure for ascertaining the causes and dynamics of the event is still ongoing.

The initial trip of the reflux pump was noted and the pump restarted, but a second trip went unnoticed. The steam supply to the column reboiler was on manual control and therefore did not trip leading to a rise in column pressure.

The consequence of this change, particularly during upset conditions, was therefore not adequately assessed.Further prevention actions:All equipment that may have been subjected to over-pressure was thoroughly inspected. PSV use was reviewed to determine the failure mechanism. The PSV inspection interval was reduced to a 12 month interval. An investigation of the reasons for the steam control to be routinely run on manual was conducted. This concluded that routine operation on automatic was unlikely to be successful.

197,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"At the time the fire broke out, on 4 ;August ;2015 at around 17.15, the substance 2,2-dimethoxypropane (DMP) was being transferred from an intermediate bulk container (IBC) into 200-litre barrels. This manual transfer was being done using the force of gravity, with the liquid running from the IBC, which had been lifted using a forklift truck, via an attached funnel into the barrel. The transfer was taking place fairly centrally on the ground floor of the production building. On the explosion zone (ex-zone) plan, this point was marked as ‘ex-filling’.According to the work instruction, a barrel pump should be used and the IBC should be earthed. During transfer, the IBC, which had been lifted on a forklift truck, was positioned over the ‘ex-filling’ zone’s collecting basin. According to statements from experts and the property insurer, for reasons that are not completely clear, the flammable vapour/air mixture was ignited by an electrostatic discharge, resulting in a fire. When trying to remove the burning IBC from the production building, the forklift driver, in order to turn, initially drove with the IBC some 6 ;m backwards into the synthesis area. There the fire became so fierce that the worker was not able to continue driving. He abandoned the forklift truck with the burning IBC and fled.This created a second fire source, which was not contained by a basin. The contents of the burning IBC, which was being progressively destroyed, was therefore able to feed a constantly expanding pool fire. Because of the production building’s nearby assembly opening, which created a stack effect, the fire was able to spread unhindered to the upper levels of the building. Within a very short period, therefore, the fire had spread from the mixing and separating area to the entire building.No one was injured during the fire. The production building, however, was a ‘total loss’, and its remains have since been demolished. The tank farm was not notably damaged.The total material damage amounted to approximately EUR ;22.3 ;million.No material damage was found outside of the operating site.

Emergency Response","The transfer activity must be described in more detail in the operation instructions or in a special work instruction. More detail should be provided on the following aspects:- the specified workflow (use of the barrel pump),- strict confinement of the transfer process to the transfer basin,- clear designation of the relevant potentially explosive zones,- use of suitable equipment in the zones,- use of suitable transport packaging (conductivity of the IBC),- ensuring that all fittings, work materials and equipment used during the transfer process are earthed. This includes the containers (barrels) to be filled and their peripheral equipment (funnels, ramps). The workers concerned should provide written confirmation that they have understood this. Structural fire protection:Following the incident, the main building can no longer be used, and it is currently being demolished. When planning the new building, the relevant regulations (above all the Industrial Buildings Directive [Industriebaurichtlinie — IndBauRL]) must be taken into account. Regardless of the resulting requirements that must be included in a structural fire protection plan, the experts recommend not only introducing fire protection means to separate the tank farm, the container storage facility and production facility from one another, but also separating the production facility into two fire compartments, as appropriate, to minimise the extent to which an initial fire can spread throughout the whole building.For the tank farm, which may still need to be used, the possibility of a secure sprinkler system must be provided, i.e. a second, independent water supply must be secured. Handling burning containers:Where a container is particularly hazardous, e.g. it is leaking or there is a (small) fire, arrangements must be made as to how it can be handled safely.In any event, it must be ensured that the burning container is not moved.

A member of staff attempted to stop the temperature increase by exchanging the cooling water for brine.

Situation so far:Subsequently, a pressure surge must have occurred that was so strong that the seal between the dome cover and the base of the reaction vessel was forced out and partially destroyed.

212,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides","Due to the failure of a joint on a Schenk filter, there was a release of a significant quantity (approximately 5 tonnes) of material, known as Quatmass Extraction Solution. This material contained Reglone, and approximately 2 tonnes of Ethylene Dibromide, both of which are toxic. A batch of Reglone product was being manufactured and had reached the filtration stage. Production had been normal up to this point. ; ;The batch ;was sent from the reactor vessel to the Schenk filter under 6 barg pressure, and the usual sequence is that when the vessel is empty the pressure drops and the pressure indicator in the Schenk filter senses this and sends a message to the process control computer to open the nitrogen valve. The nitrogen is then introduced under pressure to drive the filtration.On this occasion the automated nitrogen valve opened, but the nitrogen pressure did not rise ;above 2 barg, and a message was sent to the process control computer stating 'Pressure slow in rising'. The operator did not notice this for ;about 45 minutes due to other duties. ; ;It was not an alarm.When the operator ;saw the message, he sent another operator out to investigate, and he saw that there had been a loss of containment and the batch material had been released through the flange connected to the pressure relief valve. It ran down the side of the vessel, through the lagging and into the site drains.The gasket was protruding through the side of the flange and it is thought it had been blown out when the nitrogen was put on to the filter unit.The joint had been broken at the shutdown about 6 months previously, but the unit had been in operation since then handling around 20 batches per week. The filter unit, and a second ;identical one, were installed 20 years ago.The main causes for the ;failure were around the loss of compression on the joint faces and the subsequent displacement of the gasket. The most likely causes were; 1) The use of bolts / studs with different tensile strength causing uneven stretching of the bolts in the flange joint;2) The machined surface finish on the safety valve flange face is not to the correct specification;3) External loading on the joint caused by unsupported pipe work;4) Inherent vibration in the Schenk.The most significant deficiency was considered to be inadequate floor and filter mountings. Carcinogenic material (EDB) released from the filter and collected in the site drains. It was subsequently diverted to the site emergency containment tanks. Due to errors causing delays at the site effluent treatment plant, some effluent was sent to Yorkshire Water, rather than kept on site. Yorkshire Water has since verbally confirmed their samples showed no indication of a consent breach.Remedial action taken: Repairs were carried out to support the Schenk filter and improvements made to flange integrity. Further work was undertaken to investigate vibration as a direct result of operational procedures (such as the backwash procedure which was highlighted as being different to what the filtration consultant expected).  ; Root Cause Analysis undertaken by Syngenta identified a number of further operational and engineering improvements. These were implemented during plant outages in October and November 2010 and included: - Redesign of the filter backwash system - Installation of pressure differential instruments to monitor filter performance - Installation of two accelerometers which continuously monitor vibration and will trip the filter spin sequence at predetermined levels. - Filter refurbishment  ; To ensure the equipment is maintained to standard additional engineering routines have been introduced including specific checks of the support legs &amp; plinths, joint integrity and bolt torque.

223,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"Accidental spill of crude oil over a rain water drain, followed by a fire and an explosion in the Beach of Aterro near the refinery.For the unloading operations of crude oil through the Ocean Terminal of Leixoes (OTL), operational instructions were issued and distributed on 13/10/1998.The assistant manager of the logistics department and the manager of the Product Handling department worked out a document, dated 14/10/98, with the title ""Procedure for Setting the Pipeline under Pressure with Crude Oil"", concerning the operations of purging the soft water contained in the pipeline connecting the buoy with the refinery of Porto. The contents of the document remained known only to them. The document contained the pumping flow rate (ca. 500 m#/h), the volume of water to be purged (2900m#), the time estimated for purging the pipeline (ca. 6h), the frequency of supervisions of the system (in the first three hours not less than three times an hour; starting from the fourth hour continuous monitoring until conclusion of the purging), the circumstances for which the sewage treatment plant of the refinery would have to be contacted as well as the conditions under which the pumping operations would have to be stopped.On 14/10/98 at about 20:30 h the deputy captain of the ship Enalios Tethis signed a discharge protocol, named ""Operation Agreement &amp; Sequence Agreement"", according to the parameters agreed upon with the Product Handling department, without making any reservation from the part of the tanker concerning the assurance of minimal flow-rate of 500 m#/h .Once the unloading started, the CLT informed the Product Handling control room that according to the information given by the ship, the pumping flow-rate corresponded to 300 m#/h.The assistant manager of the Logistics department requested around 21:05 from- CLT an increase of the flow rate to 500 m#/h. He again requested the control room to confirm jointly with the CLT the flow rate, because the level in the channel was already reaching half level.Around 21:15 the manager of the Product Handling Department communicated to the operator of the waste water treatment plant that the water which was being purged was clean, so that drain 25 (rainwater) could be diverted from the storm-water basin to the sea, an operation which was performed.Around 21:20 the ship informed CLT that pumping was being carried out with a flow rate of 500m#/h , information which was transmitted to the control room of the Product Handling department.Around 21:40 the assistant manager of the Logistics department requested an increase of the pumping flow rate of further 100 m3/h, having observed that in the purging zone (zona di spurgo) the water remained clean and that the level in the channel had increased to near to reach its maximum level; he also requested the CLT to confirm the flow rate. Around 21:45 the deputy captain of the ship informed that the pumping was being carried out at a flow rate of 650 m#/h. After having established that the channel could not contain a higher flow rate, the assistant manager of the logistics department requested not to increase the flow rate any more and, in case of any variation, to reduce it. Instructions were issued to the ship not to exceed a flow rate of 700 m#/h.During shift change at 22:00, the operation coordinator was informed about the situation and it was particularly recommended to him that ""if traces of oil appeared, to request U 7000 (on-site waste water treatment plant) to divert drain 25 to the storm water basins, and after 24:00 to divert the drain to the storm water basin in any case even if no oil spot appeared"".The operator of the waste water treatment plant declared that at 22:30 he saw traces of hydrocarbons in the water flowing in the outlet box of drain 25 towards the rainwater drain; he then went to the storm water basins to ascertain the situation. Around 22:40, he alerted by phone the control room of the Product Handling department and started the operations for diverting drain 25 from the rain water drain to the storm water basin of the waste water treatment plant. Meanwhile, the operator of the Security Service passing near the control room was requested to check what was occurring in drain 25.At 22:45 the release of crude oil by drainage system 25 occurred.In consideration of this situation, it was ordered to divert drain 25 towards the storm water basin and to contact CLT to stop the pumping from the ship.At approx. 22:50 the operator of the waste water treatment plant performed the diverting operation of drain 25 from the rain water drain towards then storm water basins, but due to the high flow rate a part of the effluent was still discharged to the sea. It has not been determined if the operator acted following a specific order from the control room of the Product Handling department or if he acted on his own independent initiative. The operator declared that he acted on his own initiative. The Product Handling department declared on its side that a specific request had been issued.Around 23:05, the Product Handling department requested CLT to interrupt the pumping, which was carried out. The Product Handling department informed CLT that the deputy captain had communicated that until 23:00 2900 m3 had been discharged.Around 23:15 general alarm was released while the fire which had deflagrated on the beach of Aterro propagated through the rain water outfall to the rain water outlet box inside, the refinery .The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,fluid release to water,"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)",,VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),,,,,"02.

224,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"Unexpected release of hydrogen sulphide gas occurred at a plant for production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solution. Two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The release occurred because the pH value of the solution was too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. The two workers were killed. The initial concentration of the released gas was at least 1000 ppm.
1999, the initiating event was the addition of solid phase sodium
sulphide to liquid phase spent pickling solutions, which had far too
low a pH value. The intention was to precipitate heavy metals in the
solution. However, the very low pH value induced formation of hydrogen
sulphide gas rather than precipitation of heavy metals.[TEXT 1]
On the afternoon of the 9th of may 1995, there was a release of hydrogen sulphide gas at a plant, which resulted in the death of two process workers. The release occurred at a plant for the production of ferric chloride from waste pickling solutions. The two workers were manually adding solid phase sodium sulphide to a liquid phase pickling solution. The pH value of the pickling solution was much too low and too much sodium sulphide was added. Therefore instead of the expected chemical reaction (precipitation) an unexpected reaction (formation of hydrogen sulphide gas) occurred.

228,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"This accident is being reported under the provisions of part II of appendix VI on ""specific technical interest"".A cistern containing 16,300 tons of 96 % sulphuric acid was ruptured. The entire contents of the cistern was spilled out into the tank bund and then out into Kemira Kemi AB's (KKAB) dock. When the sulphuric acid came into contact with the water there was an exothermic reaction, which produced a vapour cloud that drifted northwards along the coastline with the wind. After the spill there was approximately 2,000 tons of contaminated sulphuric acid by water in the bund. About 100,000 sq.m. of the ground surrounding the spill has been affected by the acid. An acid cloud was produced when the sulphuric acid came into contact with the salt water in the bund. The salt water consisted of approx. 0.7 w-% chloride ions. The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) has estimated that the sulphuric acid together with the salt water produced a cloud (gas and aerosol) consisting of hydrogen chloride (HCl). During the first few minutes the maximum concentration of HCl was estimated at 6 000 mg/m3 at some spots near the scene of the accident. ; After 10 min the highest concentration was 600 mg/m3 and the concentration declined to 60 mg/m3 after 60 min. Fortunately the cloud moved along the coast line and mostly over the sea.

Personnel in the docks area, 8 people (5 KKAB employees and 3 from Helsingborg's port), ran in different directions to reach safety. 5104 - corrosion/fatigueThe primary cause of the incident was the leak in the coolant supply pipe. The pipe is made of concrete and came into use during the first half of the 1960s, most likely 1963. The pipe had been in use through the years without any major problems ever having been identified. The only damage noted to the pipe was a leak at the pumping station in 1999.An inspection of the failed pipe after the incident detected little or no internal corrosion, but heavy external corrosion to the concrete. In certain places on the pipe the concrete has corroded so severely that the reinforcing steel has been exposed. ; ; The appearance of that part of the coolant supply pipe that was studied suggests that the corrosion is as a result of an acidic attack on the concrete. ; According to a German DIN standard (1991) DIN 4030 and a European standard EN 260 (2001) a strong attack on concrete occurs if the pH level in surrounding water is ; &lt; 5.5 and a very strong attack is if the pH level is &lt;4.5.In 1989 a ground pollution study was carried out in the area, during which one of the sample taking points was close to the failed coolant supply pipe. At this point the pH level was measured at approx. 4 in the shallow groundwater. With this new knowledge gained the company drew the conclusion that this pH level entailed risks for strong acidic attacks on the concrete. The same conditions apply to the risk of a sulphate attack in the pipe. ","vessel/container/containment-equipment failure

Causes - Organisational","The incident on 4th February 2005 has led to the initiation of a number of activities at KKAB, all of which have as their objective the prevention of a similar incident being repeated. Here is a description of current activities: 1. Immediately after the incident an inspection began of the whole of KKAB's industrial area, to assess if there were other important installations (from a safety perspective) in which a similar incident could occur. ; With this as a basis, and in conjunction with the following points, the company will decide on the design of future water supply.2. As the other supply pipes for the coolant in the docks area could not be guaranteed to be in a satisfactory condition, especially as sulphuric acid had leaked into the pipes during the incident, the decision was promptly taken to lay new pipes. The new pipes are made of plastic, PEH 100, and lie overground along the shoreline in the docks area. ; Risk analyses have been carried out and the new pipeline has been put in place. The company has also decided to build another pipeline parallel to the first. ; The pipes will be covered by macadam.3. At the time of the incident the pressure in the coolant supply pipe fell from about 6 to about 2 bars. The operator's instructions then were to ensure continued coolant supply to the works, which is why another pump was started. Such a powerful drop in pressure probably indicates that something serious has happened with the pipe. Therefore, the new pipes are installed with a low pressure fail-safe, which shuts off the pumps if the pressure falls below a level lower than those expected within normal operating conditions.4. KKAB has started working out what guidelines should apply for ground pipes within the company's area. Choice of material, ground conditions, proximity to installations relying on pressure, dimension and protection measures taken are some of the parameters that will be taken into account. 5. The company has also started an overhaul of routines in order to increase focus on ground pipes. "

247,Other Event,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"The company manufactured a variety of powder coating and paint additives by polymerizing acrylic monomers in a 1500 gallon reactor.The company had received an order for slightly more of an additive than the normal-sized recipe would produce. Plant managers scaled up the recipe to produce the required larger amount of polymer, and added all of the additional monomer needed into the initial charge to the reactor. This more than doubled the rate of energy release in the reactor, exceeding the cooling capacity of the reactor condenser and causing a runaway reaction. The reactor pressure increased rapidly. Solvent vapors vented from the reactor's manway, forming a flammable cloud inside the building. The vapors found an ignition source, and the resulting explosion killed 1 worker and injured 14. The blast destroyed the facility and damaged off-site structures.The accident has been investigated by the US Chemical Safety Board.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,"On the day of the accident, a modification in the production recipe was introduced in order to produce approximately 12% more of the final product obtained from a normal batch. The plant superintendent determined the quantities of solvent, monomer and initiator needed for the reaction, which initially was not particularly vigorous. Several minutes later, the senior operator heard a loud hissing and saw vapor venting from the reactor manway, which forced him out of the building. He returned with a respirator and was able to start emergency cooling water flow to the jacket. However, the building exploded 30 seconds after he left.Investigations after the accident revealed that there were several causes that led to the runaway reaction.- The company did not perform hazard identification of their processes. No formal hazard review had been conducted to address what could go wrong during reactor operations. The company had minimal safety information on its polymerization processes, even though this was the core of its manufacturing business. Product formulations were optimized to meet customer specifications. However, reaction characterization and calorimetry were not performed to establish process equipment performance requirements. Indeed, calorimetry experiments performed after the accident proved that the modifications on the recipe generated a heat output that was 2.3 times that of the original recipe, clearly exceeding the heat removal capacity of the condenser and the emergency jacket cooling of the reactor.- When scaling-up new products from the laboratory, previous plant managers had typically estimated initial production batch sizes based on past experience, or with simple trial-and-error systems. Batch quantities were gradually increased until the sight glass in the condensate return line showed that the condenser was too close to flooding, or that another performance limit, like the reactor pressure increase, was being approached. The condenser's cooling capacity was not documented, nor could the cooling load be determined with the available instrumentation. As a result, information essential to the safe operation of the reactor was not available.- Most of the management and operations personnel had been on the job less than one year (in some cases much less) and lacked previous polymer manufacturing experience. Personnel, including site managers, were thus poorly prepared to recognize potentially hazardous changes to product recipes, or to respond to an incipient runaway reaction. Additionally, the company had no chemical or other engineer on staff, and none had been contracted to evaluate the hazards associated with reactive operations at the site.- Based on the accident investigation, it turned out that the employees and managers had little or no understanding of reactive hazards. They had not been trained on, and did not understand, the safety margin of safety needed or available in their polymerization operations. Furthermore, they had little knowledge of the sensitivity of the reactor to changes in product recipes, batch sizes or reaction conditions.- The company relied primarily on a procedural safeguard to prevent loss of reactor control: the batch sheet, which was used as an operating procedure at the site. But additional process safeguards, necessary when coping with the effects of runaway reactions, where totally missing in the reactor set-up. Examples of systems that could have helped to prevent or mitigate the accident are: ; ; ; ; - high pressure alarm systems. ; ; ; ; - automatic emergency cooling water to the reactor jacket. ; ; ; ; - automatic shut-off of initiator feed. ; ; ; ; - automatic injection of ""short stop"" solution to stop the polymerization reaction. ; ; ; ; - automatic venting or dumping of the reactor to a safe location.- After the investigation of the accident, it was found that operators used to open the reactor manway after every batch cycle to clean the reactor. Long standing practice at the facility was to then close the manway and secure it using only 4 of the 18 clamps specified by the manufacturer. The risk posed by this practice had not been recognized because the reactor normally ran at near-atmospheric pressure, for which four clamps were thought to be adequate. Under this situation, it was estimated that the manway began to leak flammable solvent vapors when the reactor pressure reached approximately 23 psig, well below the reactor's maximum allowable working pressure of 75 psig.- The design of the tubular heat exchanger used as a condenser made it difficult to remove for inspection or cleaning. Inspection of this equipment after the accident showed that it was badly fouled, likely reducing the condenser capacity at least 25 per cent. The company had no program to systematically monitor and control water side fouling, and it was found that there was not any inspection ; or cleaning process to remove the scale, rust and sediment accumulated on the tube during 30 years of service.",instrument/control/monitoring-device failure,,"management organization inadequate

The reaction was carried out without ad adequate addition of ammonia and therefore the normal small hydrogen chloride production could not be compensated. Hence, the excess of hydrogen chloride destabilized the suspension of PVC-latex which coagulated. The coagulation of the latex caused the mixer failure but there was no indication of it. Consequently, a local overheating resulted and a decomposition on PVC occurred because the steam temperature (165-175°C) was higher that the PVC decomposition temperature (144°C). Being the PVC decomposition exothermic, the heat caused an expansion of coagulated latex clogged all the pipings including the inlet to the bursting disc and to the safety valve. The uncompensated hydrogen chloride started to react with the material ; of the reactor (the Duplex stainless steel was not resistant against hydrogen chloride at high temperatures). Though the steam supply had been stopped and the external cooling started (activated by the release of hot gases from the reactor), the vessel burst because the wall thickness was reduced from 9.8 mm to 2 mm.

After the accident it was concluded that this step must have been executed in a too short period of time and only a partial boil-off of liquid chlorine resulted. So this section was still containing some liquid chlorine which was heated to about 80°C.- 04:45 An attempt was made to free the heater section E-2504 (see diagram No 2) from (residual) chlorine by the introduction of pressurized air. The presence of a one-way valve may not have been recognized (see diagram No 2). It resulted in chlorine inlet into the process air system.

The vessel had to be cleaned with water because of problems in the normal process. The vessel was situated at a level of about 60 feet high. In order to ad water to the vessel the pipeline was used. At ground level the pipe was disconnected and a cast iron Saunders valve was attached. The fire water system was attached to the Saunders valve. Not very well known was the fact that in the pipeline were quantities of AlCl3 and TiCl4 as a deposit. The water and the deposit caused rapid reactions. The rapid pressure rise had the force of an explosion, but the pressure itself did not exceed the burst pressure of the pipe. This is proved because of the fact that longitudinal cracks did not develop. The fast pressure was transmitted in all directions. As mentioned before the pipe resisted the pressure in circumferential and of course also in longitudinal directions. But the pressure (probably a pressure wave) was directly transmitted through the water to the end, where the Saunders valve was situated, in almost completely closed position. The pressure wave resulted in a brittle failure of the Saunders valve housing. As a result of the thrust of the water and the vapour, expelled at a high speed, induces strong reaction forces on the pipe, resulting in a pipe whip and so destroying the pipeline in several parts.The loosening of the pipe end and the vertical ends of the pipeline in which water was able to form a kind of blockage, may have played a role in the accident. Also important is that probably the single reaction between water and TiCl4 at itself was not enough to be the cause of the accident.

NAMED SUBSTANCE","Human cause, unclear markings caused confusion on whether the valve was open or shut.A temporary employee, who had only been working in the company since a short period of time, first of all CLOSED the valve under supervision of his mentor. After a while the temporary employee returned without his mentor. Since he had doubts if the valve was really closed he turned it a second time. At that time he thought he closed it, but in fact with this action he OPENED valve again activating the alarm. He then decided to turn the valve a third time. Now the valve was CLOSED. What he did not know was that there is always a (minor) delay in the decrease of pressure in the pipeline because of which the alarm bells continue to go off for a short time.Some background information: The pipeline is some hundred meters long and ; there is still some pressure on the pipe immediately after changes in the valves. In other words there is always a certain delay when closing the pipe due to which the pressure appears high in a small part of the pipeline. One has to take this delay into account.He then asked for assistance of the mentor. (The mentor had not been present when the temporary employee had opened and closed ; the valve a couple of times.) They decided to turn the valve a fourth time thinking it would close it, but actually OPENING it. And -most importantly- they turned off the alarm. Not taking into account the alarm had only went off because of the delay in the pipe line. To sum up, the status of the valve when they left was 'OPEN' and the alarm bells did NOT go off since they had been turned off. ; ; Why did this confusion about opening or closing the valve occur? Two years prior to this accident a similar accident had happened. The correction that was applied after that accident was the following: a warning sign with the word 'OPEN' was placed over the valve (in other words it covered the valve). However, in a closed situation the warning sign showed the word 'open' and in an open situation the sign showed the word 'open' as well. The only difference was that in an open situation the word 'open' was read vertically and in a closed situation horizontally. Hence, the improvement/correction that was made due to the accident that had happened 2 years before caused even more confusion for someone that did not know the practical reason behind it.

It was foreseen that at the end of that shift the unit would have reached normal operating conditions.When the accident occurred, at ; 02:20 h of 19/06/1997, ; unit 2000 was at the final start-up stage, it remained ; only to introduce rectification vapour in column T 2002, raise the temperature to normal operating values in furnaces H 2001 and H 2002, ; the feed (charge) of crude oil was of 90 m3/h (cubic metres an hour), the crude oil exiting from H 2001 had a temperature of 320°C and the residues exiting from H 2002 had approx.the same temperature. Distillation products were collected already in both columns and were to be deviated through slops until information on the quality of the product was obtained.Until the accident everything had been going on normally. Attention must be drawn to the fact, that after the shut-down of the unit and the performance of major maintenance operations it is normal that minor leaks (releases) occur in equipment, the leaks are eliminated by tightening the fastening (fixing) elements. This is the reason why ; in those circumstances the start-up of the units is performed slower in order to allow the detection of possible (eventual) anomalies (disturbances), avoiding that these present a significant risk.In fact the start up was to be slow, for the reasons indicated above, moreover there had been ; a certain delay due to a leak which occurred in heat exchanger E 2001, which led to the reduction of the discharge. The introduction of the pipes of the heat exchangers in the respective (corresponding) bodies was made with the help of cradles in order to ; avoid forcing or deforming the equipment, and thus to damage it.The inspection services made a hydrostatic test on the heat exchanger (at a pressure of 37 kg on the body and 24 kg on the pipes, during one hour) after it had been assembled; according to the results of the acceptance test there had been no need of re-tightening.An operator of ; Unit 2000 detected the leak (release) which was at the origin of the accident; while he was putting into operation one burner of the furnace H 2002 he saw a very large cloud inside that unit, originating in the upper part (top) of one of the connection joints between the body and the primary chamber (antechamber) of the heat exchanger E 2007B, on the north side.

On the day of the accident the dispersion feeding pipe was blocked by solidified lithium metal. To unblock the pipe, a wooden stick was used to push (to avoid sparks and any damage to the reactor's enamel). After removal of a blind flange, the valve on the cleaning nipple was filled with paraffin (prior the reactor and the connected piping were depressurized). The wooden stick used for pushing was wrapped with a piece of cloth soaked in paraffin and the piece of cloth was put over the opened valve in such a way that the reactor should be protected against air entry. As the blockage was unusually solid, it could not be removed by pushing. During the attempt to remove the solidified lithium, the lithium dispersion was released through the ring slot between the wooden stick and the cleaning valve and seeped under the paraffinated piece of cloth on the reactor and ignited spontaneously.

When the spare air fan was connected, the control valves opened, the lambda value of the combustion process no longer met ; the set values causing the automatic shut-down of the steam boiler. During start-up operations of the steam boiler a supply shortage of steam at 110 bar occurred causing the shut-down of one of the steam fed raw gas compressors. The excess steam had to be directed to a flare for approximately one hour.At 14:00 h the electricians requested the start-up of the repaired ; air fan motor for functional testing. The fact that the control valves of the fan were directly coupled to the rotational speed of the motor and not to the rotational speed of the fan was not taken into consideration This caused a recurrence of the situation that had occurred in the morning. Due to the fact that the steam boiler could not be started up in time the excess ; raw gas had to be directed again to the flare.Additional steam equipment operating on steam had to be shut-down in order to stabilise the high pressure steam supply situation, e.g. all steam fed boiler water pumps were shut-down. Out of 5 boiler water pumps only 2 pumps remained operative, which was sufficient for the existing loadAt 14:30 h in one of the boiler water pumps a 6 kV arc over occurred between power supply and pump motor, causing the failure of that pump.With only one pump functioning, the feed water supply of the last operating boiler was no longer guaranteed.The last steam generator was shut down when the signal ""feed water level to low"" was displayed. This led to the emergency shut-down of the last operating pyrolysis furnace; the shut down of the ground flare and the operation of the high-flare without steam injection. Operating the high-flare without steam significantly increased soot emissions with respect to normal operation. The high-flare was fed from then onwards with the evaporating refrigerants (ethylene, propylene) from the refrigeration circuits mixed with residual substances present in the refrigerated part of the ethylene plant.During a walk round the plant at approximately 17:30 the plant personnel noticed flames spreading from the furnace and alerted the on-site fire-brigade.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,02.

 ;Description of incident: 
 ;On 17/03/2004 work was carried out in the 220 kV REW transformer
station. Following completion of this work, there was a 3-pole earthed
short circuit at 4.14 pm due to a mistake by a REW worker whilst

networks in the plant failed as a result. Gas turbine 1 in the south
RWE power station, which is necessary for establishing an insular
supply within the plant, unexpectedly failed 180 milliseconds after the
short circuit. This was the result of a malfunction in the regulatory
auxiliary supply. The automatically activated isolated operation
crashed a few seconds after the failure of gas turbine 1 as a result of

414,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"An explosive fire took place in the melt shop of a factory in Tornio. ; A main valve of oxygen gas pipeline broke at Avesta Polarit's Tornio melt shop line number 2 on the 19th of September 2003. The accident caused an explosive fire, which was extinguished within half an hour. The accident took the lives of three peoples. ; No-one was injured. The melt shop was in an annual maintenance shutdown and control work was being done on valves on the oxygen distribution pipeline. Main pipeline runs from the exterior of the building to the melt shop. The back-pressure valves had been changed and the testing of the system was starting up. The accident investigation has been carried out by the national Accident Investigation Board and TUKES. Accident Case HistoryA fierce fire costing the lives of three workers took place at the Tornio (Finland) steelworks of AvestaPolarit Stainless Oy on September 19, 2003. The accident site was the melting shop of the steelworks. The melting shop line number 2 that had been built the previous year was in its first annual maintenance shutdown. During the shutdown back pressure valves were to be installed to pipelines conveying the so called raw oxygen and pure oxygen. Therefore they had been closed and made purged by air. Most of the work had already been completed, and the foreman of the factory and the foreman of the subcontractor started preparing thestart-up of the oxygen systems.The men entered the valve room on the third floor of the melting house, where they successfully opened the main shut valve of the raw oxygen line. Thereafter they started opening the main shut valve of the oxygen line. The valve was apparently stuck, because the bolt pin holding the hand wheel in the valve stem snapped. The men asked for pipe tongs, with the help of which they started turning the valve hand wheel stem. They managed to turn the stem about one turn, corresponding to a 9° turn of the disc. At that moment an explosive fire broke out. It kept burning fiercely as the oxygen was leaking from the damaged piping. Both the foremen that had been opening the valve and a welder who had come to the scene by chance were killed.Judging by the burn marks the fire started from the oxygen line main shut valve; a butterfly valve with a nominal diameter of 300 mm. Gaseous oxygen compressed to a pressure of 35 bar was flowing in the pipes. There was a by-pass line beside the valve. Due to safety reasons this line was supposed to be used to equalize the pressure on both sides of the main shut valve before opening the latter. After the accident the by-pass valve was found to be in a closed position, although no specific information about the use of the by-pass line was found in the investigation. Whether or not the by-pass line was used will have affected the cause of the fire.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,conflagration (a general engulfment fire),,,,,,,"03. OXIDIZING
00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","On the basis of the investigation the fire may have ignited in three different ways:1) The slide bearings of the valve disc stem may have been damaged, and two steel surfaces may have come into contact in the damaged area. When the valve was being opened, these two surfaces may have become hot by the friction and set fire to the plastic bearing material which ignites more easily than steel.2) The valve may have been opened without equalising the pressure. In this case the dust particles from pipeline in the fast oxygen flow of the valve gap would have struck valve parts, become hot, and ignited the valve to burn in the oxygen. 3) A foreign object may have got stuck in the valve and formed a friction pair that caused friction heating when the valve was being opened.

415,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
During a storm at the end of the working period (most employees had already left the plant), two very powerful, successive explosions occurred in less than 5 seconds in the fusion cavity of the furnace, causing extensive damages to the foundations of the furnace. The first explosion, undoubtedly in the form of a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT, fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later. The first explosion could have generated a pressure of 10 to 20 bar on the sides of the pit, and the generated seismic wave was recorded by several seismographs in the region and furnished an energy undoubtedly at least 1,000 times greater than that of the electric arc produced in the building.An inquiry commission was rapidly formed after the accident and worked in close contact with and under the supervision of administrative and judicial authorities. It made use of the services of experts in the following fields: explosions, use of natural gas, prevention, meteorology and storms, metallurgy, civil, mechanical and electrical engineering, combustible dust. The analysis of statements and interviews indicated that a luminous phenomenon in the foundry, followed, almost immediately, by the first explosion and 2 seconds later by a second explosion. The examination of material in the foundry shop near the presumed starting point of the explosion showed that the motor of a mobile hoist located 15 metres from the supposed point of explosion presented indisputable traces of the passage of lightning-related current. In addition, it was possible to determine numerous possibilities for the routing of the current leading to the starting point of the explosion. In particular, the casting pit itself, where the explosion started, was the best grounding point in proximity to the motor. It was supposed that the molten aluminium alloy could have led to: either an explosion of aluminium alloy droplets dispersed in air (which involves a suspension process) or a reaction of molten aluminium with water. The first was opted for. The molten aluminium was suspended in air by the action of the shock wave produced by the electric arc. The shock wave dispersed 150-300 kg (of a total of 1,200 kg) of molten aluminium alloy around the casting frame in the form of a fog of fine droplets. Only a part of the energy of the shock wave was used in this dispersion process. The fog then exploded (as a detonation equivalent to 200 kg of TNT) as a result of the droplets/air reaction. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two seconds later, as a result of the rapid vaporization of cooling water in contact with the molten metal, which fell from the upper part of the casting pit. The first explosion fractured material, destroyed the casting frame and caused the essential part of the damages noted. It also caused the break of a cable in an ingot lowering machine and caused plates and aluminium alloy not dispersed by the electric arc to fall into the casting pit. The second explosion was equivalent to 100 kg of TNT and occurred two second later.

Even if the foundry was equipped with natural gas piping for heating the furnaces, the hypothesis of the formation of a flammable mixture with air was excluded because of: the large volume of the flammable mixture necessary to explain the magnitude of the damages (no major leak was noted), the fact that the mixture would have accumulated in the upper part of the building (whereas damaged were on the ground) and the absence of heat effects resulting from a gas explosion.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state),rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state),,,,,"CAUSES:

421,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
A wrong mixing operation in a reactor in the production area Z9 could caused an explosion followed by a fire. More precisely, the addition of a new product to the silicon oil caused a release of hydrogen, and perhaps also sodium hydride, due to a wrong pH control (this reaction, when was experimentally performed in a laboratory, caused a deflagration). The worker who performed the defective operation was alone in the plant. Seriously burned, he had been found many tens of metres from the point where the explosion occurred; it is unknown however if he was displaced by the explosion or if he was transported there by other people or if he had escaped before the explosion. A call for help was received at 03:07 by the centre of alert transmission of Tours and it was re-trasmitted to the centres of Chateau-Renault and Amboise. At 03:20 a fire fighting vehicle from Chateau-Renault arrived on-site. Since the accident led to the rupture of three fire hydrants, two lances were installed taking water from the Brenne river, 500 metres away. At 03:40 the fire fighting vehicle from Amboise arrived and at 04:06 4 lances were in operation. Meanwhile, the fire covered a surface of about 2,000-3,000 m2. At 05:52 two foam guns arrived from Tours and, when at 06:15, 2 foam tankers arrived on-site, they were put in operation with positive effects due to the synthetic foam used. Owing to the formation of a toxic cloud inside the building, at about 05:00 the Mayor of Chateau-Renault decided to evacuate a building where 200 handicapped people were housed. From 05:00 to 08:30 analyses of the cloud composition have been performed every half an hour. Those analyses revealed the presence of hydrogen cyanide, carbon oxide, nitrogen oxides and halogens. At 08:30 the analysis revealed only some traces of carbon oxide. There was the risk of intoxication for the rescuers (because they had no suitable personnel protection equipment) and also a risk of explosion of nearby reactors and vessels. The water used to cool these vessels and to extinguish the fire (500-600m3/h) caused the pollution of the Brenne river crossing the site. A dike was built a few hours after the fire started to prevent discharge of used fire fighting water to this river. Despite these measures, phenols were found in Loire river fed by the Brenne river. The authorities decided to interrupt (for three days) the distribution of drinking water to 200,000 people. Drinking water needs were estimated to be 45,000m3/day and were covered by various sources (interconnection with water networks of nearby communities, the use of water sources not affected by the pollution, the use of deep wells, extended the use of bottled mineral water and the use of two trains of 3,000 m3 capacity each).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,"pool fire (burning pool of liquid, contained or uncontained)",,,VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),,,,"01.

During a weekly test programme, at 11:30 two maintenance operators started to test the isolation valves and the space piston pump. At about 11:50 this spare pump was switched-on and, immediately after, a leakage from a piping located above the operators occurred. They quickly escaped towards the control room before the gas was ignited by the pyrolysis furnace. The Internal Emergency Plan was activated. The unit was shut-down and fire protection means were activated while the affected area was evacuated. The fire was not extinguished to avoid formation of an explosive gas cloud; at the same time the protection of structures exposed to intense heat radiation using cooling via fixed monitors and of the pyrolysis furnace by means of a fixed water curtain was necessary. Isolation valves around the unit on fire were closed to reduce the amount of flammable substances potentially involved. However, one of the isolation valves could not be completely closed (because the accident occurred during a test) and therefore the duration of the fire was prolonged. After 10 minutes other pipes were ruptured causing an escalation of the fire, which was finally extinguished after 13 hours (at about 00:45). Damages to the plant were confined to an area of 20-25m radius on a platform at an elevation of 6m. A nearby school was evacuated when a hydrogen chloride concentration of 10-15ppm was measured in the vicinity. Hydrogen chloride concentrations measured indicate that confinment should have been preferred versus the evacuation.

A person of the ""Movement Service"" detected on the ""transethylene"" pipeline (10"" diameter, operating at a pressure of 45 bar) an ethylene leakage inside the refinery. Immediately, he alerted the personnel in the proximity of the leakage to abandon the site and called in the company fire brigade, that intervened immediately after. Not withstanding the alert, a vehicle of an external company passed through the gas cloud, and its motor stopped due to the high concentration of ethylene in air. The driver, trying to put again in operation his vehicle, created a spark which ignited the flammable gas cloud resulting in an explosion that caused the rupture of the ""transethylene"" pipeline and its deplacement. This originated a jet-fire, fed by the ethylene escaping through the ruptured pipeline, directed towards a warehouse containing tens of barrels of liquid hydrocarbons (ethyl acetate and dimethylcycloctadiene) and sacks of thermoplastic caoutchouc (rubber). A fire started in the warehouse. The shock wave produced by the explosion caused also the displacement of a second ethylene pipeline (diameter 6"", operating at a pressure of 90 bar) located under the 10"" pipe on the piperack. The displacement caused its fall and rupture, resulting in a second unconfined vapour cloud explosion. The company fire brigade was assisted by the fire brigades of nearby companies and the local fire brigade in extinguishing the fire.  4 fire fighting vehicles were damaged by the explosion of the gas cloud but, after about 2 hours, 2 of them were already operating. 2.5 hours later a third one was operating too.

The decomposition of hydrogen peroxide resulted in the pressurization and the following rupture of the pipeline connecting the oxidizer to the extractor.

CAUSES: 
The most probable cause for the pipeline rupture was the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (gaseous oxygen formation and temperature/pressure increase) due to the presence of unstabilizing agents in suspension (metallic particles, rust). The initiating event was the failure of the automatic control devices together with a series of human errors during the attempt to repair them. Particularly, the safety procedures followed were not suitable for the event. Furthermore these procedures were not fully applied. Some valves, that could be manually closed, remained opened. As those valves were necessary for the isolation of the various sections of the production chain, the solution passed from the oxidation to the extraction step and back again via the pipeline.

Gas was quickly ignited and the explosion that occurred was heard about 15-30 km away. A large fire then developped. On-site emergency plan was immediately activated by the Director of the refinery.05:30-06:00 - Arrival of first emergency teams. 3 fires followed the first explosion: the catalytic cracking unit itself, a close 5,000 m3 reservoir containing heavy distillates and a group of pipings transferring liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. The off-site emergency plan was activated by the Prefect. Set-up of an official emergency management and coordination post by Prefect services, fully operational at 07:00.09:45 - Failure of a 2,000 m3 reservoir containing a mixture of sodium hydroxide and light hydrocarbons, due to thermal radiation. Last minor explosion due to quick lighting of flooding mixture occurred.13:00 - All fires were put under control. Due to partly damaged flare system, fire brigades decide to let small jet-fires continue to burn in order to ensure the safe depressurization of involved installations.6 operators were killed and 1 operator severely injured in the FCC control room by the first explosion. Minor injuries among fire brigades. Facilities were destroyed or severely damaged within a 2 hectares area around the FCC unit, including the control room common to FCC and associated facilities. Many window panes were broken off-site in a 1,000 m area around the refinery. In some particular directions, window panes were broken at 8 km and damages to house tile-roofs at some hundred metres occurred.About 250 firemen called from TOTAL site, 3 neighbouring industrial establishments and 4 local districts were mobilized.

436,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"The accident involved a cadmium distillation column. The column was
formed by a stack of 59 silicon carbide trays heated to 1000°C. The
heating chamber enclosing the bottom of the distillation column was
kept depressurised.
The temperature was monitored at different points of the distillation
unit, and the temperature control was assured by regulating manually
both the gas flow to the burners and the draught. The essential
maintenance task was to absorb zinc oxides releases which occurred
relatively frequently between the trays, fouling the installation. ; The
cleaning operation was performed through inspection openings on the
walls of the heating chamber, which were closed during operation with
refractory plugs and sealed with clay. This operation was performed by
refractory bricklayers employed by the company or by a specialised
subcontractor.
Independently, the columns were operated permanently during 18 months.
Any shut-down or significant drop in temperature would have caused the
rupture of the trays, particularly sensitive to thermal shocks.
The accident scenario was as follows:
- 27/05/1993: 7 weeks before the event, start-up of the column in which
the accident originated after refurbishment (new tray stack, new flues)
- 24/06/93: start of the effective production phase
- 24/06/93: 17:00 h an abnormal rumbling noise which had never been
heard before in a refurbished installation, alerted the operators. An
inspection showed a temperature rise in the heat exchanger and a
significant fouling.
- 25/06/93: during the morning before the event, several operations
were carried out without success to re-establish normal operating
conditions.
- 25/06/93: at 12:10 h a sudden divergence of the lateral temperatures was observed in the heating chamber.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","The synthesis operation had already been performed several times over 2 years.A material balance has demonstrated that the flow of imide compound transferred in the reactor was 8 to 9 times higher than foreseen. The operators could control this flow by regulating the number of pulsations of the dosing pump by means of a regulating screw and by acting on two manual valves located upstream of the pump. After the accident, ; the dosing ; pump was found to be regulated for a high flow and the two upstream manual valves were completely open.The reduction of an imide compound by sodium tetrahyddroborate in an ""ether"" type solvent medium is a hazardous reaction. Sodium tetrahyddroborate and Aluminium trichloride can decompose in presence of water, even if in trace quantities, forming eventually hydrochloric acid or hydrogen.When the accident occurred significant quantities of hydrogen were formed by the runaway reaction and were not absorbed by the reaction medium. The ignition of the gas may have been caused by static electricity in the reactor, a hot spot or ; the presence of diborane and water traces.The process instructions did not consider the flow regulations to be performed during transfer ; operations. These flow regulations were left to the know-how of the operators.The workers who were working at the reactor when the accident occurred were experienced with the exception of the worker who performed ; the imide compound transfer for the first time.The unit worked discontinuosly and was essentially operated manually. Considering the hazards releated to the reaction, the equipment has to be absolutely reliable and there has to be enough personnel to control the functioning of the equipment in completely safe conditions. These conditions were not guaranteed the day of the accident because:- 2 pumps with different flow capacity could be used for transfer operation, but ; no flow control meter was provided.- there were no safety or devices to alert the operators in case of a drift of the operating parameters (high flow, high pressure in the reactor,)- the unit was not equipped with remote control valves allowing the reactors to be isolated rapidly.

478,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,"On a chemical  platform, a release of hydrocyanic acid occurred in a unit for the synthesis of hydrocyanic acid, belonging to the unit for the production of adiponitrile.

The release is small but the lessons learned with regard to the organisational aspects of the installation are interesting. The accident is therefore notified only for this reason, since the criteria of Annex VI are not fulfilled.

The accident is classified at level 0 of the gravity scale, based on the available information.The accident:The accident occurred on the HCN production installations, at the level of a mist separator placed on the residual gas transfer line between the head of the HCN absorption tower and the CNIM boiler.Several incidents had occurred during the previous days:- Problems in extracting liquids at the base of the HCN purification tower (tower H2243) from March 20 to 26 made it necessary to use a second pump. On March 27th, the decision was taken to shutdown the distillation train to clean the HCN polymers that had formed.The shut-down procedure foresaw: ;- draining the HCN from the train, up to 2% HCN in the drainage water, by directing it toward the ADN unit,- performing air stripping until an HCN concentration is reached which allows the equipment to be opened, the residual gases being burned in the CNIM boiler.On March 28 and 29, the distillation train was drained (shut-down of the HCN converters, as well as the natural gas heaters and the upstream TGN). Draining remained difficult due to extraction problems at the base of tower H2243. On March 29th at 13:00, the decision was taken to switch over to the air stripping phase.The concentration of 1.2% HCN in the towers, measured at the base of tower H2242, was higher than the usual values although it was below the threshold value of 5% tolerated during the operating mode.In compliance with the safety procedures, the workshop was evacuated on March 29th at 16:15 p.m. before the stripping operation was launched. The order to evacuate was cancelled 15 minutes later and 9 people returned to the workshop.The explosion occurred at 16:40 at the level of the mist separator H1191 located at 5 m height on the gas line.The two nearest analysers (Toxguard) located at a distance of 10 and 15 m indicated 30 ppm of HCN; the concentration values dropped after 5 minutes. Other equipment located 100 m from the unit sporadically detected values in the order of 4 to 5 ppm of HCN.The shop personnel were evacuated to a withdrawal zone and the stripping operation was shut down immediately.

A safe-T-tree was then constructed after having eliminated the highly improbable potential causes: a flashback produced from the boiler was stopped by the separator tank (H1191).According to the operator, the accident was caused by: ;- the presence of polymers in the tower which slowed down the drainage of HCN, ; - at the start of the air stripping phase, an operation conducted with an HCN content higher than normal in the residual gases, the normal drainage of the trains not having been conducted, ; - the presence of several inconsistencies in the implementation procedure: ;- since 1989, the stripping procedure has consisted of a blocking phase based on a safety threshold level set at 5% HCN in liquid phase.

The new brick is 250mm thick. ;- A few bricks of the arch's outer row were found on the periphery of the arch's metal ring. ;- A sample of metal ejected by the furnace door was analysed :. ;- The examination of the off-gas recorder on the stack outlet highlights the rapid increase of CO content at the time of the accident. ;- No water leak was reported in the cooling systems and the refractory material of the hearth was in very good condition. ;- While the load remaining in the furnace was melting after the accident, melting difficulties and rapid temperature increases to 1,700° C followed by abrupt drops to 1,550° C were noted. The temperature rise/drop phenomenon was noted 2 to 3 times. This phenomenon is interpreted by the dissolution of unmelted products in the bottom of the furnace and their rise to the top.Based on testimony by the personnel, reconstruction of the previous casting operation through to just after the accident, and post-accident investigations, some hypotheses relative to the phenomenon observed were presented. After analysis, some of them were finally rejected (Water leak inside the furnace, presence of a hollow body, collapse of the arch, collapse of unmelted elements attached to the side of the furnace, water present in the slag tank).On the other hand, the following causes have been retained : ;- The nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace did not melt completely; the intense mixing of the metal by the injection of gaseous oxygen helped the nickeled sand rise to the surface. The nickel oxide was deoxidised by passing through the metal; the oxygen thus released combined with the carbon present in the bath and produced large quantities of CO and CO2 very rapidly. This hypothesis is substantiated by the recording of the gas analysers; a calculation shows that this reaction produces 73 m3 of CO in a few seconds. ;- The unmelted nickel sand in the bottom of the furnace contained a certain quantity of water and gas, held under pressure by a layer of pasty metal. The blast would have been due to the release of these during the fusion operation was an aggravating factor in the number of people injured. gases; a calculation shows that this phenomenon generates 8 m3 of steam. ;- The analysis of the causes concludes that the loading method (nickeled sand in the bottom of the furnace) was the origin of the accident.The presence of personnel not necessarily required around the furnace aggravated the consequences of the accident in term of human victims.",unexpected reaction/phase-transition,,,,Yes,"Causes - Human

Emergency Response","With regard to technical aspects:The fire-walls and the emergency services response operation allowed the accident to be kept adequately under control, but the fire-wall's efficacy was compromised by the presence of the sky-dome too close to it. It is important to consider the risk of ignition of elements that can melt when heated and which can compromise the efficacy of protection devices such as fire-walls.AdministrationThe applications for authorisation of installations already in use must be the object of formal notices, according to Article L514-2 of the environmental Law.In hazard studies, it is imperative to describe the substances that may be formed by decomposition during a fire, and to evaluate the consequences, in order to adjust the prevention, protection and response measures.Crisis management:The event had an extensive media coverage through the broadcasting by the local radios of the confinement instructions, ; information which was picked up by the national radios. A large number of press organisations immediately sent reporting teams to the site; they arrived before any overview of the situation could be obtained and even before any real operational command post could be set up. This almost instantaneous media coverage of the event created a strong pressure of information demand on all those involved in the response operations, even before the establishment of structures for co-ordination and for the collection of reliable information on the event and its consequences.As an accident occurs, the emergency services must prioritise the following two main aspects of crisis management:* ; The mobilisation and the up-grading of the system for immediate emergency response* ; The activation of the co-ordination and command structure, in order to facilitate: ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; - The drawing up of a preliminary overview of the situation and the correct assessment of the event; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; - The activation of a structured system for gathering and recovering verified information; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; - Control of the spreading of the warning after the event.The last point can be achieved only by the activation of an operational command post on the site and of a crisis management team in an operational command room of the prefecture.

Before rapidly dissipating, the cloud containing ammonia and nitrogen oxides sickened witnesses who complained of eye and throat irritations. The atmospheric pollutants released after the detonation lead to the formation of nitric acid (HNO3), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from ammonium nitrate. As a precautionary measure, the local governmental authority (“Préfecture”) requested that the population of Toulouse confine themselves to their homes. This measure, the efficiency of which was limited owing to the damage to numerous homes, nevertheless reduced the number of traffic problems after the accident. From a strictly technical point of view, and according to the measures and observations made by the experts, it should be noted that the detonation gave rise to an overpressure in the order of 140 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the lethal effects in the danger studies) at a distance between 280 and 350 m and 50 mbar (threshold retained to characterise the irreversible effects on human health in the danger studies) at a distance between 680 and 860 m. This observation can be constructively compared to the fact that there were victims resulting from indirect effects up to 500 m away on the one hand, and injuries caused by broken glass at distances of a few kilometres away, on the other hand.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,,explosive decomposition (of unstable material),,,,,04. EXPLOSIVE - note 2(a),"On the eve of the explosion, 15 to 20 tons of ammonium nitrates with an additive in qualification phase was brought into shed 221. On the morning of the explosion, products derived from the packaging of the ammonium nitrates and the manufacturing shops were also transferred into the shed. The last addition of material by bin coming from another storage zone was made less than 30 min before the explosion Several inquiries and expert evaluations were conducted: - judicial inquiry, - administrative inquiry conducted by the French Ministry of the Environment with the participation of industrial hazard experts [3], -ATOFINA (mother group) internal inquiry, - inquiry by the CHSCT (the plant committee for hygiene, safety and working conditions). Many hypotheses were formulated to explain the explosion: Unintentional external causes associated with accidental technological or natural phenomena (methane due to underground bacterial activity, lightning, meteorite, falling aircraft parts, explosion of a bomb or nitrocellulose underground following previous site activity); all of these hypotheses proved to be unfounded. Intentional external causes (attack, malicious mischief, missile) conjured up and spread by public opinion in the same context as the ""Twin Towers"" terrorist attack in New York, on September 11, 2001. From a legal standpoint, this hypothesis is not supported by any tangible facts. A process incident (an internal electrical fault at the plant, electric arc, missile effect from a part projected at high speed…). An examination of manufacturing parameters at the time of accident would not however explain this type of incident. Concerning the possible high speed projection of a piece of metal causing a primary explosion in a filter at the top of a tower near the site of the explosion, experts feel that the kinetic energy developed by the projection of debris from the filter would be insufficient to cause the nitrate contained in shed 221 to explode.As far as an accidental chemical reaction is concerned, the nitrates used were polluted by iron oxides, sulphur and in contact with bitumen used to pave the floor of shed 221 or following the mixture of incompatible chemical substances, such as ammonium nitrate with sodium dichlorocyanurate (NaDCC, a product used in treating swimming pools); the incompatibility of these substances was highlighted during court-ordered laboratory tests. Favoured differently by the entities concerned, none of these hypotheses have lead to a consensus. In may 2006, the final report presented by the expert investigators to the plaintiffs supports the theory of a chemical accident, attributing the causes of the disaster to an unfortunate combination of a few dozen kilos of sodium dichlorocyanurate with 500 kg of ammonium nitrate spilled on the main nitrate pile 20 minutes before the detonation. It is worth noticing that, since the very beginning of the industrial manufacturing of nitrogenous fertilisers early in the 20th century, ammonium nitrate have been involved in several major industrial accidents while being stored or dispatched . On July 26, 1921 in Kriewald (formerly German Silesia), the ""dislodging"" of wagons filled with ammonium nitrate using explosives caused a detonation killing 19. Less than 2 months later, on September 21st, in Germany's Oppau plant, blasting work on a pile of aggregated fertiliser mix containing ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate produced a detonation responsible for 561 deaths, 1,952 injured and the near total destruction of the town. Twenty years after that, in Belgium, explosives were still being used to disaggregate a pile of ammonium nitrate, resulting in another several hundred deaths at Tessenderlo. Despite the production of coated nitrate to subsequently avoid nitrate aggregation, several detonations of ammonium nitrate still occurred either in France or abroad, thus confirming the complex characteristics (e.g. chemical composition, particle distribution, density, humidity) associated with these categories of products and their detonation potential under circumstances promoting their instability: mixing, hazardous outcome when reacting with other materials or pollutants, temperature, containment…",,,,,Yes,"Emergency Response
Other","An inquiry by the Parliamentary Commission was opened October 24, 2001 relative to the safety of industrial installations and research centres, and relative to the protection of persons and the environment in the case of a major industrial accident. As of January 29, 2002, this commission had formulated 90 proposals along six major themes: reducing the risk at the source, the human factor notably with the employees playing a role in the prevention of accidents, the implementation of greater openness and pluralistic expertise with regard to disasters, urban planning questions, the adaptation of judicial procedures and the compensation of the victims of industrial catastrophes.
Within a few months, the French public authorities undertook different reflective thinking and actions: In the field of prevention, in order to: -Broaden the field of application of the SEVESO 2 directive by lowering the ammonium nitrate threshold, - Limit the risk presented by ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers by adapting their technical specifications to make them intrinsically less explosive, - Improve the prevention of major accident risks in ports and railroad yards, - Ensure the continuity of the security between fixed installations and the transport of dangerous substances, - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the hazards associated with ammonium nitrates (fertilizer and industrial nitrates), - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the cohabitation of activities at risk with other economic activities, residential housing and thoroughfares, - Harmonise the risk evaluation methods between France and the member States, - Access to improved harmonisation of methods and inspection means of establishments at risk by the public authorities, - Reinforce cooperation between research and expert assessment organisations in the European Union, - Re-examine the safety conditions of high-level SEVESO facilities,
O In the field of inspection, in order to:- Reinforce significantly the staff of the inspectorate - Reinforce the inspectorate through technical support for the examination of danger studies, - Check the fertilizer storage and ammonium nitrate storage facilities governed by the environmental legislation. O In the field of openness and information to: - Create more than 200 experimental local information and joint action committees (circular of July 12, 2002), - Publish (via Internet) the new operating authorisation orders accompanied with the inspection reports. The scenario of detonation had not been selected in the risk analysis of the plant either by the operator, the inspectorate or by third experts, because the existing feedback led to consider as unlikely the detonation of ammonium nitrate when compliant with manufacturing standarThis disaster clearly shows that the contingency plans must consider a series of scenarios of the type, severity and kinetics representative of possible accidents even if their probability is considered extremely low. The method for evaluating the risk proved to be insufficient. The danger study must consider the danger potential of installations, examine possible scenarios and their consequences including the most dramatic or improbable, estimate probabilities and characterize the modes of occurrence. Reducing risks at the source must aim at reducing the potential for danger, the probability of accidents occurring and limiting the consequences through appropriate organisational and technical systems. The legal system did not enable sufficient control in terms of urban planning, particularly for the existing industrial sites whose surrounding area had already been urbanised."

Emergency Response","The accident scenario ""fire of a transformer"" had not been considered in the safety report made in 1992, probably because this kind of material is present in many sites and thus it is someway a bit trivialised.

These measures have been taken only after the fire had been extinguished, in reason of the fact that the event was notified to the competent authorities only two hours after the fire had been put under control.In this kind of event, where the entire public service system is concerned by the response measures, it is essential to work in synergy.

DANGEROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT - R50,"All of the defects found on the pipe were similar in terms of:- The main direction of fissuring: lengthways in the bottom part of the pipe (lower part of the curve),- Location: close to a singular zone, namely change of gradient or angle (45°, 30°, 22°, 11° bends or high point).It was clearly demonstrated that the damage to the pipe was due to a mechanism of stress corrosion in an acid environment. Stress corrosion is a fissuring mechanism that requires a combination of the following three factors:- A stress (or permanent distortion),- A material sensitive to the phenomenon,- A corrosive environment.All of the basic data for the pipeline specification was analysed by experts appointed subsequent to the failures in the pipe. The investigation produced several findings:- Soil / structure interaction As regards the soil, the specification for the pipe required minimum compacting for the bed and sides. Now soil tests made around the pipeline showed compacting values lower than those specified. The pipe thus became more oval in places than the maximum acceptable value.- Hydraulic specification In order to protect the pipeline both from excess pressure (water hammer on start-up) and from negative pressure (pumping stop / start stage), a 20 m3 water hammer protection chamber was installed at the start of the line. To be effective, it was specified that the chamber should be pre-pressurised at 0.5 bar; now on testing following the various incidents, it was found that the chamber had been ore-pressurised at 1.7 bar. The whole of the pipeline thus suffered a more violent pressure drop when pumping stopped (the greatest negative pressure having occurred in the first two kilometres). Similarly, the potential existence of air at high points, because of the absence of vents at the highest points, could have had the same hydraulic consequences, from both excess pressure and negative pressure. - Life of composite pipelines The design curve for the pipeline as regards the risk from stress corrosion supplemented with some experimental values in the field of substantial distortion shows that the burst-time for composite pipelines is a few dozen hours for substantial distortions.The failures occurred near to or at high points and close to a change of direction, which confirms the role of hydraulic transitions. Some failures occurred in a zone where it is difficult to have correct soil compacting (pipeline near to the water table and concrete bore holes). Lastly, most of the failures (6 out of 8) occurred in the first two kilometres, which is the area where hydraulic forces are highest. ;",corrosion/fatigue,,,,Yes,"Causes - Plant/Equipment
Causes - Organisational","The lessons to be learned from this series of incidents cover both the technical domain and also the organisational aspect.TechnicallyAlthough the pipes and their assembly complied with the provisions in the regulations as required by the order, which was conformed on 16 July 2002 by a satisfactory resistance test, that the installation of the pipe and pressure control systems were not, however, in accordance with good custom and practice (non-compliance with the specification as regards installing, incorrect sizing of the buffer chamber and under-estimate of the number of vents).On the evidence, the management of project, which involved various parties (internal and external engineering departments, the fabricator of the pipe, civil engineering contractors appointed and their subcontractors, operator), was the cause of several of the faults, in particular, in the systematic pre-checking of calculations, the installation conditions for the pipe and compliance with various rules for pressurising the facility.Financial aspectsThe series of incidents resulted in substantial costs for the operator (business interruption, repairing leaks, changes to the discharge point into Seine Bay, investigations after incidents, repairing the pipe,#). For example, shortening the old outfall and remaking a diffuser cost ; 329,300 # excluding VAT, and setting up the new discharge point has been estimated at 5,500,000 #. For economic reasons, this work had to be done as temporary replacement of the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and Hode and would never have been undertaken if the new pipe had been operational from the 3rd quarter 2002.Organisational aspectsThe operator's HSE management system required improvements."

The only two people working on filling the bombs in this building were the victims, their bodies being found some fifteen metres away.As of today, different investigations are in progress regarding this accident:- ; ; ; a judicial investigation (a criminal investigation assisted by a laboratory of the scientific police);- ; ; ; an administrative investigation.The effect of the explosion of building 9 was surprising. There was a detonation, although the behaviour expected of the products present in the storage facility where the detonation occurred was:- rapid, highly intense flame without any significant blast, in accordance with the classification 1.3 of these products as defined in the pyrotechnic regulations in force.The zones of effects determined by the operator in the safety assessment initially performed were not more than 20 m for the lethal effect zone and 38 m for the irreversible effect zone.Considering the consequences of the accident, an expert advice bureau concluded that the detonation was equivalent to 15 to 30 kg of TNT. The shockwave recalculated on the basis of these assumption indicates a maximum extent of the radios for the lethal effect zone and the ; irreversible effect ; zone respectively in the order of 40 m and 70 m.In view of observations made on the ground it is possible that one of the 2 persons, or possibly both, were inside the candle loading room at the time (9B2).It is also possible that this operation was ; being conducted at the same time as the manufacture of the bombs (forbidden procedure).Hypotheses concerning the circumstances:The formation of a crater inside the storage area indicates that a considerable quantity of products detonated. Investigations finally took 3 potential causes into consideration: ;- the risk presented by the products usually stored in this area may have been wrongly assessed (the risk of detonation had not been taken into account). It is customary in this branch of activity to classify stars and small-diameter bombs as non-detonating products. As these products are not sold as they stand, the operator did not charge an approved certification body to perform the necessary testing procedures for classification. Storing the products in bulk and in a confined space may support the hypothesis of detonating product behaviour. Nevertheless the ignition remains unknown. ;- The products stored were exposed to a violent shock and the energy absorbed released the detonation. On this hypothesis, the shock may have been generated by a first accident on one of the two adjacent workstations (9B1 and 9B2), ; transmitted to the storage area (9A). However, detailed examination of the concrete floor of these two rooms (9B1 and 9B2) revealed no traces of explosion (no impact, no fragmentation of the concrete or traces of burning). As regards the possible transmission of the explosion from one area to the other, it should be noted with respect to the projectiles recovered and the accounts of witnesses, that at the time of the accident, the door of the storage area may have been left open (though this is prohibited by the safety regulations) and there may have been a handling trolley in vicinity of this door. This trolley might have been pushed towards the storage area by the projectiles generated by a first explosion. Pieces of this trolley were found 150 m from the building in the direction of access door to room 9A.- There may have been an unauthorized detonating product inside the room which caused the bombs to detonate when it caught fire. The product input/output register of building 9 was examined. The register did not show that storage capacity had been exceeded or the presence of any products other than the 50 and 60 mm bombs. Analysis of the debris from the bottom of the crater may allow to identify the composition of the pyrotechnic compound that detonated.Hypotheses concerning the triggering event:The initial ignition source and its location still remain unknown. A first explosion one of the workstations would have left marks on the concrete. An ignition source could have ; directly generated in the storage area in case of improper handling. However, this second possibility cannot be confirmed by the positions of the bodies of the victims.",,,,,Yes,Causes - Organisational,"A this stage of the investigation, lessons learned from the accident are primarily of organisational nature:The best possible risk characterisation of the products (according to the kind of storage or transport), with particular attention given to intermediate products. Since the operators of small installations have difficulty in classifying all their products by means of standardized tests, at the very least, a stricter implementation of existing regulations has to be sought;Compliance with the onsite safety procedures in force in the different areas. Vigilance on this point tends to wane with time and at busy periods;Maintenance of rigorous control of the operation conditions and the amounts of hazardous products presents in the manufacturing and storage units.These basic rules already figure in the French regulations applicable to this activity sector.On the technical level, even if the exact origin of the disaster remains unknown, several aggravating factors have been identified:The bulk storage in crates of the candle bombs, creating thus confinement conditions for these products, undoubtedly contributed in crating detonation conditions;The fact that the stored bombs were primed could have led to their mass ignition by friction. This is because the priming process consists in coating the outer surface of the bombs with a layer of gunpowder for the purpose of ensuring the propagation of the flame from one bomb to the next inside the candles;The proximity of the storage area of these products to the two manufacturing shops tends to introduce a risk of domino effect which may be wrongly evaluated.

The accident:On 26 June 2004 at 16.38, a fire broke out on oven 42F201. Large flames enveloped the oven (the metal of the convection part became red-hot) and gave off black smoke. The fire does not appear to have been preceded by an explosion, but by a suspicious noise, described by witnesses as a whistling noise (as of a valve) growing more and more intense, and then a ""mechanical"" noise.Staff working on a neighbouring unit quickly released alarm and had already manually activated part of the water curtains by the time the safety teams intervened. The operator then cut off supplies to the unit (load and hydrogen) and started decompression to the flare, which was successful in rapidly reducing the combustion. The structures supporting the oven and subjected to intense heat flow were cooled.The external fire was brought under control in 30 minutes using the onsite emergency response services of the refinery. The external emergency response services dispatched to the scene did not need to intervene. The combustion of the products from the reactor loop (reactor 42R202) continued at a high level of intensity for several hours in the convection chambers of the oven and the flues at the outlet of the latter.The output of the common chimney collecting the emissions to the atmosphere of the HDS units, atmospheric distillation no. 2 (DA2) and extraction of aromatics (hydrogen treatment section no. ; 2 - HDT2) was seen to produce flames intermittently for several minutes accompanied by a considerable plume of smoke.None of the detectors of ambient H2S on the unit triggered an alarm. In contrast, it is probable that a certain quantity of ; H2S was released at the flare.Among the pollutants monitored continuously by the detectors in the neighbourhood of the refinery (air quality measurement network of the Lyon conurbation), sulphur dioxide and in particulates suspension are likely to register peaks in cases of incidents of this nature.

09 i. DANGEROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT - R50","Inspection plan of the oven:The inspection plan of the oven in force at the time of the accident allows intervals for periodic inspections of 6 years and intervals for periodic requalification of 12 years according to a amendment granted by the DRIRE on 8 November 2001, when setting out regulations applicable to pressurized equipment.With this in view, the inspection department of the refinery drew up the inspection plans of the pressurized equipment of this unit according to the method known as RBI (Risk Based Inspection) in conformity with the professional guidelines of the UFIP (Union Française des Industries Pétrolières) of February 2000, recognized by the administration by DM-T/P no. ; 31 538 of 20 October 2000.The application of the RBI method is based on a software program used in the Group, named ""RBeye"", which automates the search for types of deterioration as a function of data relating to the fluid and materials of the equipment, pressures and temperature. The oven has been subjected to periodic inspections from the start, with inspections every three years until 1997, and tests every ten years. The last periodic requalification with testing took place in April 2002, and was successful. It had thus been in service subsequently for 27 months at the time of the fire.The HDS unit was inspected at the time of the general shut-down in 2002 (""metal"" shutdown) and was stopped in 2003 for a simple change of catalyst.The non-destructive tests performed since the start have consisted in measurement of thickness by ultrasound and dimensional inspections to check the absence of creep, all conducted on the radiation part, as the inspection department held that this was the most vulnerable. Since 1993, metallographic replica tests have been carried out on the radiation tubes and showed the beginnings of sensitization of the stainless steel (beginnings of corrosion which could lead to modification of the mechanical characteristics), but this was judged acceptable by the inspection department, in the absence of loss of cohesion or microfissures.On the convection part, only measurements of thickness of the peripheral elbows were made (see photo below), no anomaly being recorded. The inspection report of the periodic requalification performed in 2002 shows that, on the convection part, the visual inspection carried out on the lower layer, according to the inspection department, revealed no anomalies. In this connection, the history of the thickness measurements on the radiation tubes and convection elbows since 1993 shows no abnormal reduction of thickness.For obvious design reasons, it is impossible to inspect the interior of the tubes.The periodic requalification was accompanied by a hydraulic test carried out a pressure of 85.5 bars.Before the fire, the HDS had been operating since the previous day in ""domestic heating oil"" mode, a rate of operation considered as moderate. It was fed with a mixture of light distillate from vacuum distillation unit no. 2 and LCO (light gas-oil rich in cyclics) from the catalytic cracker unit. The sulphur content of the load was estimated at 1.16%. It should be noted that before being introduced into oven 42F201, this received an addition of hydrogen contributing to the desulphuration reaction. According to the records, the skin temperature of oven 42F201 was stable in the region of 373°C, the maximum permissible temperature being 392°C (set point).Origin of the fire:The tubes constituting the lower convection layer were found not to have melted, having seemingly been supplied to the end by the load and thus ""cooled"". Among these, one tube found to have burst (a clean break of 500 mm), has since been thought to have been the origin of the fire.Expert examinations performed:Two expert examinations were carried out, one by an external expert, the other by the Group's research centre.Expert examination by the external expert:This was carried out on 2 tubes (the burst tube and a neighbouring tube) on the basis of a geometrical, fractographic and metallurgical analysis of the burst tube and of mechanical tests and analyses by X-ray diffraction.This revealed that the rupture was caused by four types of deterioration, the effects of which had cumulatively led to a reduction of thickness to a point below that at which the tube could withstand operating pressure.These types of deterioration are as follows:- aggression supposedly due to exposure to polythionic acids: these acids form when the sulphurised constituents of the load are in contact with oxygen. This situation cannot occur in normal operation, as the load contains no oxygen. It is encountered during shutdowns or hydraulic tests. To avoid this phenomenon, a passivation operation is performed during the shutdown process (a procedure formalized since 1985). This aggression is thought to be old, as passivation has been performed since 1980. It results in the localized formation of grooves in the inside of the tubes of the oven.- reduction of thickness by oxidation/sulphuration: in the grooves formed by the polythionic acid aggression, the material (austenitic stainless steel) had lost its unoxidizable character, leading to a reduction of thickness by corrosion.- the presence of sigma phase (an intermetallic compound causing very marked fragility of the metal) in a low proportion, which may have facilitated the development and penetration of the intergranular attack.- loss of intergranular cohesion entailing slow creep which, in its turn, generates fissuring in the outer skin of the tubes: this phenomenon could be explained by poor heat exchange, due to a deposit of coke on the inside of the tube. This external deterioration of the tube was not visible to the naked eye.Expert examination by the Group's research centre:This examination conducted on another neighbouring tube revealed none of the characteristic appearance of internal intergranular corrosion found on the burst tube. However, on the outside, loss of cohesion due to creep, and on the inside, the presence of a considerable density of sigma phase were observed. The examination came to the conclusion that there were localized defects..","vessel/container/containment-equipment failure

Emergency Response","The accident is a reminder of the importance of certain problems relating to such aspects as detection, response (Onsite Emergency Response Plan), external communication and the limitations of the inspection plan of the installations.Detection and response:In the absence of fire detection on the HDS unit, staff who were present working on a neighbouring were able to raise the alarm very quickly and activate means of decompression and cooling of the in the next 5 minutes. This favourable circumstance must not be allowed to obscure the crucial importance of rapid detection of such an event, which conditions the time lag before the response of staff and the activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. Thus, in view of the reduction in numbers of staff in the immediate proximity of the installations for obvious safety raisons (a programme of construction of new control rooms remote from the units is in progress), the detection of accidental occurrences in the production units (detection of fire, gas, etc.) and the visual and auditory surveillance of the installations must be re-examined, without prejudice to the monitoring of the operating parameters.A study group was set up to clarify the modes of activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. The occurrence of 26 June 2004 has indeed raised questions regarding the formal implementation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan.It is also worth asking certain questions regarding the balance between the staff allocated to the production units and those needed for emergency response operations in case of an accident occurring. This aspect takes on particular importance outside working hours.In view of the human consequences of the fire of 26 June 2004, the decision was taken, at the request of the CHSCT, to repair the paving of the HDS unit. It would seem desirable to extend this measure to the whole of the plant.Inspection plan:The rupture of the tube that started the fire was a consequence of certain types of deterioration (coke deposit, attack by polythionic acids), which were not identified when the inspection plan was drawn up with the aid of the RBeye software program used by the Group.Further development of this tool would thus seem necessary so that it includes the modes of deterioration mentioned above and to take the age of the equipment into account in the criticality calculations. Deterioration of the tubes may also become apparent during hydraulic strength tests, provided the equipment is subjected to greater stresses than those occurring in normal service. If the initial strength test applied to the oven newly rebuilt in accordance with the decree of 13 December 1999 is suitable for addressing this concern, steps should be taken to ensure that this condition applies for similar ageing equipment.To verify the relevance of these measures, it might be interesting to make a comparison of the inspection plans for these units currently implemented in French refineries.External communication:During the crisis management operations, the information given by the operator concerning the gravity and the potential consequences of the accident, were considered as to be inadequate by the offsite services (Town Hall, Police, Emergency Response Services, Director of Sports Infrastructures, etc.).The operator, on the other hand, considers that the measures taken by the Authorities where exaggerated with regards to the nature of the occurrence. In terms of communication, a press conference was held by the director of the site on 26 June 2004 , the day of the accident, at 18.30.These diverging evaluations were examined after the event in a debriefing meeting at the Prefecture of the Rhône, which concluded that there was a need: - to improve the organization of crisis management between the Town Hall of Feyzin, the Police Authorities and the refinery,- for the operator, to formalize in his alert procedures the notion of ""events visible from the outside"", comprising a fast, systematic means of informing the Authorities, even in cases where the Onsite Emergency Plan is not activated."

Valve did not fully close and seal blown off by closing into full gas flow, leak occurred through annulus of valve.  System of work in place where hydraulics isolated and locked off when valve in open position had not been followed and electrical fault led to valve closing.  Blast furnace shut down but residual pressure in gas holder led to continuation of release, some gas flared but c.750,000 cubic metres lost via valve.The site is a new
entrant COMAH top-tier site and little previous work has been done to
evaluate the managemnet system in place to prevent and mitigate
potential major accidents. The assessments above are from information
received during the investigation into the release. These aspects will
be considered in more detail during inspection as part of the
inspection plan. No entry written.The investigation involved two main areas of interest, the demister
plate valve itself and the flare system, these are dealt with
separately below. ; 
a) ; Initial investigations showed that the reason the demister plate
valve had shut was because of an electrical short circuit between
relays 28767 the local emergency stop and 28777 the local closed push
button relay in the demister plate valve location box. ; This box had
been designed to IP65 however a compression joint in one of the top
glands had been incorrectly fitted so that part of the steel wire
armouring of the cable was above the level of the seal hence water
ingress was possible. ; This short in itself however should not have
been sufficient to cause the closure of the plate valve as British
Steel procedures required physical isolations to be fitted to the
electrical input to the local box together with the electrical and
manual operation of the plate valve clamps situated in the hydraulic
shed below the plate valve. ; None of these three isolations ; were
fitted at the time of the incident. ; There are a number of procedures
on TEMS (Total Engineering Management System) which relate to
operations on the demister plate valve. ; Of these, Job Safety Procedure
JFP607 refers to operation of the plate valve during shutdowns and
includes details on both closing and opening the valve. ; The procedure
details the need to isolate the valve electrical and hydraulic systems
to prevent unauthorised valve operations. ; The isolations referred to
in JFP607 for the valve when in the open position are detailed in
isolation no.IF4494,these are; the gas plant isolation valve hydraulic
house below the valve at the north end of the demister); and the gas
plant isolation valve electric actuator on the platform adjacent to the
goggle valve actuator in the gas main. ; When the valve is in the closed
position there is an additional electrical isolation in the switch
house. ; The isolations are made by way of isolocks on the local
isolators which are secured by an EBI lock. ; There is a master key
which fits all EBI locks, this is kept in a key cabinet in the RBF
control room and issued via a signing out book. ; The key to the key
cabinet is kept to the side of the communications panel in the control
room and is easily accessible. ; The last shutdown which required
closing of the demister plate valve was carried out at the end of
June. ; There are no records in the key signing out book between 30 June
and 9 August when, following the release the isolocks and EBI locks
were observed to be lying on the windowsill in the hydraulic house
below the valve at the north end of the demister. ; In 1996 and 1997 a
quality improvement programme (QIP) was initiated which looked at all
aspects of operation of the plate and goggle valves in the clean gas
main. ; The minutes of the meetings are attached. ; Issues raised during
the QIP included the identification of the valves (as problems had been
encountered where personnel meant different valves when that used a
particular number) and safe operation of the valves. ; Concern was
expressed about the level of isolation of plate valves as the manual
hydraulic override was not isolated. ; A was raised in which it was
stated that the actuation of a plate valve during furnace operation
could result in a large release of gas and recommended the isolation of
the manual hydraulic clamp release on the plate valves. ; Following the
plate valve QIP a committee was set up to look at the implications of
COMAH for the blast furnace. ; During a meeting on 23rd July 1997 a list
of the top ten scenarios for major accidents occurring on RBF were
presented, failed operation of plate valve PIV7 was included on this
list. ; In addition to the procedures for safe operation of the plate
valve, TEMS holds routines for the inspection of plate valves by both
electrical and mechanical inspectors. ; There are separate electrical
and mechanical routines for all plate valves, some examples are
attached. ; Those for electrical inspections are typically on a two to
four week frequency and include a reference to checking that isolations
are in place. ; In the case of PIV7 however the reference to check that
the isolation was in place was added after the incident on 9th August
so prior to the incident there was no requirement for electrical
inspectors to carry out checks that the isolations were in place on
either the electrical junction box adjacent to the demister plate valve
or in the hydraulic house despite there being requirements to check
these isolations on other plate valves. ; The schedules for mechanical
inspections for the plate valves are similar to those for the
electrical inspections and again there are no instructions on the job
for PIV7 to check isolations are in place whereas these are present on
some of the job schedules for other plate valves. ; Two routine
electrical inspections of the plate valve were carried out between the
shutdown at the end June and the gas release but TEMS contains no
comments as to the presence or otherwise of the isolations at these
inspections. ; 
b) Originally it was thought that the flare had ignited and the gas
from the gas-holder had been flared, it soon became apparent however
that this was not the case and that raw gas was released from the flare
stack during the incident. ; Operation of the flare stack can be
initiated manually or by the tripping of one or more of five pressure
switches situated as shown in the attached diagram. ; Switches 1 and 2
are set to trip at 173mbar and open flare leg A, switch 3 is set at
80mbar and opens legs A, switch 4 is set at 85mbar and opens leg B and
switch 5 is set at 95mbar and opens leg C. ; In addition there is a
pressure transmitter which ties in with the gas holder level system and
acts to open leg C. ; The flare is not normally lit but lights by means
of an air and propane ignition system when a leg opens. ; During the
incident on 9th August, pressure switch 2 tripped due to a build up of
blast furnace gas around the demister plate valve and so it was leg A
which opened. ; At the time of the incident the flare was in an alarm
mode and so there was no ignition when the flare was opened. ; The flare
had been in alarm since at least 1st August (there were no records
available prior to this date but no action had been taken to reset the
flare which was done by manually operating a button at the base of the
flare stack. ; Visual display of the alarm is given in the control room
at RBF, when the alarm comes in there is an audible alarm and a
flashing light however once accepted the audible is canceled and the
light remains on but does not flash. ; It is thought that the contents
of the gas holder were lost through the flare in around 7 minutes. ;
During the investigation into the failure of the flare system to ignite
during the incident it was discovered that in fact none of the flare
legs was operable and consideration was given to the service of a COMAH
Prohibition Notice however action to restore temporary propane
suppllies to the flare legs brought the flare back into use until
repairs were carried out.

543,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"Loss of containment of approximately 11.5 tonnes of flammable hydrocarbons at elevated temperature, following the failure of a 3"" branch on transfer line between fractionation columns, on fluidised catalytic cracker unit recovery section. The release ignited and the subsequent fire caused extensive damage to the plant.  No serious injuries.
 Discussion about the occurrence:On the evening of the 9th June the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was in the process of being restarted. The ""front end"" (see Figure A) i.e. the cracking section was started up successfully by about midnight. The intention was to then start the ""back end"" Vapour Recovery Unit (VRU or ""light ends"" section) (see Figure B) of the plant by progressively introducing hydrocarbons into each of the columns in turn.The main fractionator and absorber columns were successfully brought on line and then material was introduced into the Debutaniser column (E5) sometime after 01.00 a.m.At this stage the control room operator had difficulty in achieving the correct temperature and pressure at the base of the column E5 and this resulted in the relief valves lifting. Problems were also experienced in maintaining the correct levels in the next column downstream (the Re-run column E6) due to gas being present in the pump which controlled the liquid levels in the column. This was a common problem experienced during start up conditions.During start-up and before transferring liquids from E5 to E6, standard operating practice for plant operators is to dewater the transfer line using a number of drain points on the system. Dewatering is essential because if the water in E5 (which is operated at a high temperature and pressure relative to the conditions in the column E6) was transferred into E6 it would result in the water immediately ""flashing off"" to produce steam. The transition between liquid and vapour phases is accompanied by significant volumetric changes and this could potentially damage the Re-run column E6.In order to dewater the column a drain point at the base of the column E5 on the outlet pipework is opened and water is allowed to escape to the local ground drains until hydrocarbons are observed coming out. This operation is carried out several times prior to transfer commencing in order to ensure that all the water has been removed. The hydrocarbons discharged to the drain system are subsequently removed in the effluent treatment systems for the Complex and are not discharged off-site.Following the dewatering procedure the transfer of liquid from the base of column E5 to column E6 was initiated by the control room operator at about 03.15 a.m. This was achieved by opening a flow control valve in a 6"" transfer line between the two columns.At approximately 03.19 a.m. operators working on the plant in the vicinity of the Debutaniser column reported a leak of hydrocarbons (described as a white vapour smelling of ""spirit"") coming from the base of E5 and drifting northwards towards the hot oil pumphouse. The control room operator was notified of the leak and immediately stopped the feed to the unit.At approximately 03.23 a.m. whilst the plant operators were investigating the source of the leak and beginning to isolate valves, the release ignited and the operators ran quickly to a place of safety. A serious fire developed at the base of E5 and this then had an impact on the adjacent columns and equipment. There were no injuries as a result of the incident. The fire was automatically detected by a fire detector located in the Hot Oil pump house facing the debutaniser column E5, which alerted the Control Room.The control room operator isolated the feeds to the ""light ends"" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.The prevailing wind direction at the time of the incident took the vapours into a relatively open area of the plant where the vapours were able to disperse relatively easily. If however the wind had been in a different direction towards an area where there was a congestion of plant and equipment and ignition had occurred the consequences may have been more serious. Such a scenario had previously been identified in the BP CIMAH/COMAH safety reports for the FCCU whereby the possibility of a vapour cloud explosion (VCE) had been considered.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,"flash fire (burning vapour cloud, subsonic flame front)",,,,,,,08.

Old plant, circa 1950's vintage.  Change made to configuration of branch pre-1987.  Poor change control.  Pipework inspected for corrosion only.  No proactive surveys for dead legs/redundant drains.
The primary immediate cause of this ; incident was the fracture of an unsupported 6x3"" reducing tee branch pipe to the main transfer line between the Debutaniser column (E5) and the Re-run column (E6) of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) ; (see Figure B) due to fatigue failure. This resulted in the release of highly flammable liquid/vapour at elevated temperature and pressure, which subsequently ignited(probably on an unprotected hot flange nearby).There were serious operational problems associated with the FCCU stage two modifications in 1997/98 which were a relevant underlying cause of this major accident. ; These were inadequately dealt with by BP despite recommendations in writing from the HSE to review the process after a torch oil explosion late in 1999.BP reviewed the FCCU earlier in 2000, partly to try to determine why it was not operating properly (eventually traced to a blocked cyclone dip leg) and to compare it with BP FCCU world standards. The review findings were not implemented or communicated properly.The CIMAH Fluidised

revision claims and concludes that - ""hardware and software controls in
place on the FCCU are adequate to prevent the occurrence of a major
accident which could affect the general public, the personnel working
on-site or the environment around it."" Based on investigation findings,
this was partly unjustified even in 1997 when it was submitted, and
certainly did not reflect the reality by 10th June 2000 when the
cumulative effects of unreliability, numerous plant start-ups,
vibration and unsupported pipework factors came together. The safety
report was not proactively used as a management standard for reviewing
continued safe operation, nor used as an audit tool to verify the
claims made for safe operation. There were serious deficiencies in the

Emergency Response
Other","Measures to prevent recurrence:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) ""light ends"" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Demonstration that the mechanical integrity of pipework on the ""light ends"" section of the FCCU is assured, in particular, with respect to the following:a. Stresses caused by: ·Fabrication;Assembly and erection, including misalignment and structural attachments;Mechanically induced vibration cycling;Temperature effects and thermal cycling;Self weight and effect of supports, restraints and guides;Reaction forces and other shock loading;Pressure;Erosion, corrosion and environmental cracking.b. Dead legs and drain points to be minimised and, where retained, assessed against the above failure modes.c. Redundant equipment and pipework, including drain/vent points, to be removed, where practicable.The HSE investigation also recommended that improvements be made in the following areas of FCCU operation:-Change control - rigorous change control procedures should be employed.Risk assessment - a review of the FCCU risk assessment should be undertaken which considers critical process effects on start-up, e.g. de-watering, opening FCVs, exceeding process parameters, thermal cycling, transmitted vibration etc.Control/instrumentation/electrical equipment.Management review - a high level overview of unit operations should be maintained to ensure abnormal operation of the process plant is identified and the full implications assessed.Communications/competency - process technicians should receive additional training and instructions to enable them to recognise situations where there may be serious implications for process plant. BP confirmed that these recommendations would be addressed before the FCCU was started up again and would be dealt with in the design of the revamped ""light ends"" section.Measures to mitigate consequences:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) ""light ends"" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Emergency Shutdown ArrangementsDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified for the emergency shutdown of the ""light ends"" section of the FCCU need to be considered (in particular the following):a. Installation of remotely operated shut-off valves (ROSOVs) to allow rapid remote isolation of significant process inventories in order to minimise the consequences of an uncontrolled leak and allow remote emergency shutdown of ancillary equipment, such as pumps;b. Safe means for emergency depressurisation of columns or vessels, where reasonably practicable.Alarm FloodingDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified to ensure a timely and effective response by Central Control Building operators to those alarms necessary for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents, taking due account of the number, presentation and rate of presentation of alarms during plant start up, or other upset conditions, and any relevant factors set out in industry best practice guidelines (the Engineering Equipment and Material User's Association (EEMUA) guidelines).BP has implemented a range of measures to address these issues. Emergency response plans have now been updated to an agreed format and include reference where required to radioactive sources. ; Storm water tank capacity is being reviewed as part of the Complex sustaining capital programme. ; Procedures have been established to address the possible release of a range of substances into the effluent treatment plant during a fire or major incident.BP have reviewed and improved the on-site incident management plan. ; Area fire plans have been updated to the agreed format. A full review of the on-site emergency support provision has been carried out and improvements to the team organisation and facilities have been implemented.BP recognised the problems caused by alarm flooding and work had been commenced at the site to address the problem. A project is now under way to put software in place to manage the prioritisation of alarms properly. The projected timescale of 5 years for completion has been accepted by the Competent Authority.BP also carried out their own investigation into this incident. This resulted in a new site-wide emergency response procedure being issued to address handling asbestos and ceramic fibres during emergencies.Useful References:The official report into incident ""Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000"" is available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/index.htm.Alarm HandlingCHIS6 - HSE Information Sheet: Chemicals Sheet No 6 - Better alarm handlingTo download see www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/chis6.pdfEEMUA Guidance - Alarm systems, a guide to design, management and procurement.

The ambient temperature caused solidification of the lost inventory within the bund with no immediate risk to people or environment.Wind speed: 1.00, Wind direction: North West, Wind stability: A, Temperature: 5.00Discussion about the Occurrence:The plant had two phenol stock tanks; a larger storage tank (40 tonnes capacity) and a smaller process feed stock tank (18 tonnes capacity). The larger stock tank received road tanker deliveries and phenol needed for the process was transferred to the smaller tank in 12 tonne lots. Process phenol was then continuously circulated between the manufacturing plant and the smaller tank. The level in each tank was measured by load cells informing high weight alarms on the control panel. Shortly after a tanker delivery, the smaller (18 tonne) tank was topped up and the transfer system was set by an operator to circulate phenol for the process. However, the circulation was incorrectly set. This resulted in the closure of the smaller tank outlet and the pumping of phenol from the larger storage tank to the plant and then back into the smaller tank, which gradually overflowed into the bund. As the top-up had just been done, the panel operators had acknowledged a high weight alarm and did not spot the over-filling until the tank overflowed into the bund around it.The operator wrongly positioned valving which set the system up to take phenol from the larger storage tank, circulate it to the manufacturing plant and back into the smaller tank. The outlet of the latter had been closed hence it gradually filled up and passed out of the overflow into the bund.Had the pump mode been correctly selected for transferring to the manufacturing plant, the limt switch on the ; larger storage tank outlet valve would have been enabled and would have prevented the transfer pump operating, but ; the pump mode was incorrectly set, by-passing this interlock.Since level measurement relied on load cells, the panel operators' understanding of plant status was flawed. Just prior to the incident phenol had been transferred from the larger storage tank to the smaller (from which the manufacturing plant was supplied). The high weight alarm had been used to judge when sufficient phenol had been transferred and the alarm had been acknowledged. Not enough phenol had been used up by the manufacturing process for the weight in the smaller tank to drop and hence for the alarm to reset. Thus as the smaller tank was filling up the panel operators did not notice it.The investigation found that the mix of automated and manual systems for controlling the pump mode, switching and valve settings was vulnerable to human error.The establishment is a COMAH Lower-Tier site, which is wholly contained within a COMAH Top-Tier site.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to ground,,,,,,,,,02.

548,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"A blast furnace exploded ;at approximately 17.13 hours on 8 November 2001. The accident event began with a rapid over-pressurisation of the furnace contents in the bosh area due to the interaction of water and hot molten materials. The immediate effect of this furnace over-pressure was to lift that part of the structure above the lap joint upwards, the furnace lintel rising up off the column heads normally supporting the furnace. It is estimated that the structure above the lap joint rose by some 0.75 m. This structure, with its associated burden, was estimated to weigh around 5000 tonnes. The lifting of the upper part of the furnace left an opening of approximately 400-600 mm around the entire circumference at lap joint level. Gases and hot materials were ejected horizontally from this opening. During the period that this gap remained open, some 200 tonnes of liquid, solid, and semi-solid material were ejected onto the cast house floor. Gaseous material and dust rose into the cast house, exited through various openings in the building and into the atmosphere, where much of it ignited. A cloud of ignited dust and gaseous material was thrown several hundred feet into the air above the furnace. The furnace-top ‘bleeder’ valves also opened and discharged into the atmosphere. Gases from these valves also ignited.The furnace then fell back down vertically as the pressure decreased. During the explosion it had twisted (anticlockwise) through approximately 20–50 mm and moved a distance off-centre of about 100 mm, leaving it supported on the lower lap joint plate, with the lintel mounting positions no longer in contact with the column top flanges but instead some 50–100 mm above the column tops. This meant that the weight of the furnace stack was resting, eccentrically, on the lower lap-joint plate.There was little or no warning to personnel working on the cast house floor, although some witnesses later spoke of the event being preceded by ‘rumbles’ within the furnace moments before the actual explosion. At the time of the explosion there were three employees actually on the furnace stack, and several employees and contractors in the cast house floor area. Three employees were within a few metres of the tap hole, with several in the ‘jump desk’ (control room).For more details, See the full report on the incident ;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf ;",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,conflagration (a general engulfment fire),,rapid phase-transition explosion (rapid change of state),,,,,"02.

The ;blast ;furnace exploded due to significant internal overpressure brought about by the interaction of water and molten hot materials within the lower part of the furnace.The explosion occurred after a prolonged attempt - over two days - to recover the furnace from a chilled hearth situation caused by cooling water ingress. The immediate cause was the mixing of water and hot materials within the lower part of the furnace; the precise mechanism remains a matter that is not fully understood.The water had entered the furnace from its cooling system following a chain of events initiated by the failure of safety critical water cooling systems. At the time of the explosion, attempts were continuing to recify the abnormal operating conditions that this had created and to recover the furnace.The precursors to the explosion were a combination of significant failures in health and safety management extending over many years. These failures were not confined solely to the blast furnace plant; they extended elsewhere within the company, and in particular to the Energy Department which supported essential cooling water for the furnace.A failure to carry out suitable risk assessments for blast furnace operations resulted in the failure to implement robust technical and procedural controls. There was insufficient redundancy and security of cooling water supplies, and overall cooling system reliability showed a downward and deteriorating trend over several months.For more details, See the full report on the incident ;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf ;",unexpected reaction/phase-transition,,management organization inadequate,,,"Causes - Plant/Equipment

Emergency Response","
The investigation identified a number of learning points for the company and its blast furnace operations, the wider steel industry, and other manufacturers. These have been communicated to the company and action has followed to make the necessary improvements. Safety managementLesson 1 The company should review the role and function of the Safety Department. It should be better integrated into operational and engineering management.Lesson 2 Blast furnaces are now under the COMAH regime (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999), where identification and evaluation of major hazards is a legal requirement. Before this, predictive tools and techniques have had relatively limited use within the steel industry. Predictive tools for the assessment and management of risk should receive greater use within the steel industry and other process industries: eg Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS), Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Process Hazard Review (PHR) and Layers of Protection Analysis (LoPA).Cooling waterLesson 3 Sufficient cooling water for furnaces should be available at all times; the supply systems should have an adequate level of reliability built into the system. This reliability should be brought about by good engineering design (including an adequate level of redundancy) and suitable maintenance, and should be monitored to indicate any threats to its integrity.Lesson 4 Reliability engineering techniques should be employed to identify safety-critical plant and appropriate safeguards should be developed from these studies.Lesson 5 Closed systems for furnace cooling water, or systems with equal or better reliability, should be provided wherever reasonably practicable.Leak detectionLesson 6 Speed in locating furnace cooling water leaks is essential. Rapid leak detection relies on good engineering, adequate detection protocols and suitably trained and competent operators. All operators of water-cooled furnaces should ensure that there are adequate measures in place for prompt leak detection.Lesson 7 On water-cooled metallurgical furnaces, where it is reasonably practicable, appropriate instrumentation, specifically designed for leak identification, should be installed to give earlier and more precise detection of leaking cooler elements.MaintenanceLesson 8 Maintenance, inspection and, where appropriate, testing of plant and equipment associated with the reliable delivery of water to furnaces should be paramount. The potential effects of lack of maintenance, inspection and testing in terms of safety should be clearly understood. There should be adequate prior communication between works departments when any maintenance or other work that may potentially affect safe plant operation or reliability is proposed. Formal protocols should be considered for this. Safety-critical items should be identified and protocols and priorities established for their maintenance, inspection and testing.Blast furnace recovery and abnormal plant conditionsLesson 9 The specific process of conducting a blast furnace recovery gives rise to additional risks significantly over and above normal operational risks. It is essential that all personnel involved are aware of those risks and there are control measures in place, including arrangements for effective communication, ;such that adequate risk control is maintained.Lesson 10 A specific issue with the recovery of the ;blast furnace was that as it developed, there was an incomplete knowledge of the changing status of the furnace. During abnormal plant conditions there should be a competent senior manager detailed to retain an ‘overview’ of the developing situation and to keep a specific watching brief on critical parameters, so as to be able to inform those more intimately involved in dealing with the abnormal situation. Specific parameters in the case of blast furnace recovery operations should include such critical data as liquid iron levels, hydrogen levels and trends.Management of changeLesson 11 A formal system of pre-modification risk assessments should be instituted for any changes (including changes to operating parameters) proposed to safety-related plant and equipment. This should be coupled with post-modification safety reviews. The management of change system should include evaluation and assessment not only by the engineering and operational functions, but also by appropriately experienced and competent safety professionals. Duties and responsibilities for this should be clearly identified. Changes to the physical characteristics of plant should be carefully assessed for any impact on risk profiles and should be carried out with best engineering practice. All such changes should be carefully recorded and subsequently re-evaluated to determine their actual operational impact.Decision makingLesson 12 In emergency situations, there should be management arrangements such that there is a clear ‘line of responsibility’ for decision making. There should be no doubt whatsoever as to who is making which decisions.Lesson 13 Decisions made by managers under pressure from adverse plant or process conditions present a potential source of significant error. Adequate training and experience is essential, but more precise decision-making protocols should be available for foreseeable circumstances to guide and inform decision making. Careful consideration should be given to providing emergency event simulation training etc to build operator confidence and skills in emergency or abnormal process conditions.Design issuesLesson 14 Opportunities to achieve risk reductions by radical design improvements on blast furnaces are very infrequent. The design of new or extensively rebuilt furnaces should take into account the need to improve the reliability of cooling water supplies and to have suitable pipework layout, valve arrangements and water monitoring systems so as to facilitate prompt leak detection and remedial action.Lesson 15 The provision of improved monitoring systems, purpose-built for monitoring cooling water parameters on blast furnaces, should be considered. Safety-specific instrumentation of adequate precision should be designed and installed to address specific foreseeable operational and abnormal operating conditions.Human factorsLesson 16 It is essential during abnormal plant or process conditions that all personnel are clear as to who is responsible for decision making and that they have provided adequate lines of communication. Employees should have a precise and clear view of their roles and responsibilities, and be supported by suitable training, procedures and other job aids.Lesson 17 The awareness of the danger of water/metal and water/slag explosions should be raised among all employees engaged in processes where this is a risk. The degree of risk presented by molten materials coming into contact with water continues to be not fully appreciated.Lesson 18 The process risks associated with safety-critical plant, especially ageing plant, should be thoroughly understood through rigorous assessment processes, with these being subject to regular review. Specifically, with water systems on blast furnaces, a ‘leakage tolerant’ attitude should not be allowed, ;especially with older furnaces. Such raised acceptance of water leaks increases the risks of an adverse event occurring at some point.For more details, See the full report on the incident ;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf ;"

NAMED SUBSTANCE","The primary cause of the explosion was the erosion/corrosion of the 6 inch diameter pipe which carried the overhead line from the De-ethaniser to the Heat Exchanger in the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP). The failure occurred downstream of, and in close proximity to, a water injection point that was not part of the original design.Examination of the failed elbow of the pipework showed that it had failed due to an 'erosion/corrosion' damage mechanism which, over time, had reduced the wall thickness at the outside of the elbow to such an extent that the wall could no longer withstand the internal pressure within the pipe. The wall thickness had been reduced from around 7-8mm to a minimum of 0.3mm. When the pipe failed, it burst open catastrophically,causing a 'full-bore' type of release of the pipe's contents.Metallurgical examination of the pipe revealed that the uncorroded sections of the pipe were internally coated with black iron slphide, known as the 'passivation' layer which, once formed, serves to protect the carbon steel material from further corrosion. However, when the water injection was in operation it washed away the protective coating leaving it open to attack by corrosive agents in the gas stream. Hence the elbow was subject to erosion/corrosion, a process that resulted in the thinning of the pipe wall and eventual failure.The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf",corrosion/fatigue,,"management organization inadequate

Emergency Response","Measures to prevent recurrence: Actions taken:a.The company undertook a piping inspection programme 'Hawkeye' at all the higher risk refinery piping systems. This was essentially a Risk Based Inspection review and as a result approximately 3,200 lines were inspected - about 15% of the total refinery system. Another project 'Project 570' was initiated to review the remaining 85% of refinery piping, and 62,000 inspection locations were reviewed, following the guidance in the American Institute Piping Inspection Code API 570, covering the inspection, repair alteration and re-rating of in-service piping systems.b. ConocoPhillips senior management requested a third party audit of all their facilities worldwide, both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing). This was conducted by specialist consultants with a worldwide reputation in the field of process safety.c. The refinery organisational structure was revised to provide clearer definitions of the responsibilities for mechanical integrity. Inspection and mechanical integrity and their associated actions are key risk control activities, and the monitoring of their performance metrics are reviewed routinely by the refinery leadership team. Conclusions and lessons learned:a. Management of pipework inspectionConocoPhillips failed to implement an effective system for the inspection of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), to complement that in place for process equipment. The system fell far below recognised industry good practice at the time. ; In addition they failed to use knowledge and experience from other sections of the plant that should have identified the need for more inspection of the SGP pipework. Over time sufficient pipework condition data should have been obtained, and entered onto an inspection database, to verify the believed integrity and inform assessments of future inspection requirements. Without this both the system and the assessments were inadequate.Key lessons:- Effective pipework inspection systems are a vital major accident prevention measure for high hazard pipework.- Such systems should at least meet current industry good practice standard- Decisions on inspection intervals should be informed by suitable and sufficient information on process conditions and previous inspection findings.b. Management of changeThe design and installation of the water injection point in the pipe was not subject to any management of change assessment. Had such an assessment been carried out, the corrosion risk that the injection point introduced for the downstream pipework could have been identified. Similarly no assessment was made of the changes in the use of the water injection point, between continuous and intermittent, over the lifetime of the plant. The frequency of use was a major factor in the rate of the corrosion of the pipework. During periods of continued use more frequent or detailed inspections of the pipework should have taken place to adequately monitor the integrity of the pipe.Key lessons:- Effective management of change systems, which consider both plant and process modifications, are essential to prevent major accidents.- Particular care is needed to ensure that 'quick fix' modifications, during the commissioning and early operation phases of new plant, are covered.c. Management of corrosionConocoPhillips corrosion management on the SGP was not sufficiently thorough or systematic to prevent the failure of the pipe. Some positive actions were taken, including the appointment of a full-time corrosion engineer for the refinery, the introduction of divisional corrosion reviews and monitoring of process streams by sampling, and the installation of corrosion probes, following receipt of specific information in 1992 about the vulnerability of carbon steel pipework in the vicinity of water injection points. Unfortunately these activities were allowed to lapse with the result that there was both insufficient data on, and inadequate resource or focus applied to, corrosion as a potential major accident initiator on the SGP.Key lessons:- Systematic and thorough arrangements are necessary for the effective management of corrosion on major hazard installations.- Such arrangements should ensure that any available information on relevant corrosion degradation mechanisms is identified and acted on.- Adequate resource, including relevant expertise, should be applied to ensure that adequate standards are achieved and maintained.d. CommunicationTwo significant communication failings contributed to this incident. Firstly the various changes to the frequency of use of of the water injection point were not communicated outside plant operations personnel. As a result there was a belief elsewhere that it was in occasional use only and did not constitute a corrosion risk. Secondly, information from the injection point inspection, which was carried out in 1994, was not adequately recorded or communicated, with the result that the recommended further inspections of the pipe were never carried out.These failings were confirmed in a subsequent detailed inspection of specific human factors issues at the refinery. Safety communications were found to be largely 'top-down' instructions related to personal safety issues, rather than seeking to involve the workforce in the active prevention of major accidents. The inspection identified that there was insufficient attention on the refinery to the management of process safety.Key lessons: ;- Effective communication is an important element of any safety management system. In the context of major hazard establishments the accurate recording and effective sharing of information and data relevant to plant corrosion is essential for major accident prevention.- Communication systems should aim to actively involve the workforce in the prevention of major accidents as part of an adequately resourced process safety management system.Measures to mitigate consequences: Specialist consultants were employed to review the blast damage and explosion over-pressure calculations to improve predictive knowledge. Software used to predict explosion over-pressure was updated and used for all the Humber refinery occupied building risk assessments.Recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.Lessons from the emergency response on-site and off-site were shared with local industries, emergency planning and the emergency services through the local Major Hazards Group. A process was set up to handle concerns among the community and to carry out repairs in a timely fashion. An additional off-site community alarm was installed to cover South Killingholme residents furthest away from the refinery who could not always hear the existing alarm.Useful references: The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf"
552,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"30 tonnes of para-Toluidine were released from a bulk storage tank whilst a leaking pump was being replaced. The maintenance technician removed the pump and was collecting a new part from the stores when the line isolation failed.

",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to ground,,,,,,,,,01. VERY TOXIC,"A work request was raised to replace a leaking pump for a bulk storage tank containing para-Toluidine (PT) on Monday 22 July 2002. The steam was turned off and the single automated isolation valve to the pump was closed.On 25 July work began to replace the pump. The line was broken to remove the pump. The maintenance technician then went to collect a new part from the stores leaving the work site unattended. No additional isolation was provided.Whilst the technician was away from the work site molten PT began to flow from the pipe over filling the spill bund and spreading across the site. It appears that the valve had failed or was not closed. In addition, the PT had not solidified as anticipated - it is likely that this was due to the head of available liquid in the storage tank and the high ambient temperature on the day of the incident.There are 2 principle causes for this incident. Firstly, the single automated isolation valve was open at the time of the release although it appears that it had been closed before the work began. At present, the nature of this failure is not clear. The clean up exercise continues and an assessment of the valve will be made when access is available.Secondly, the level of isolation provided was inadequate. ; The design of the plant means that there is only one automatic valve between the storage tank and the pump. Reliance was placed on the single closed valve and the nature of the product i.e. that its melting point is 44°C.A tank containing 30 tonnes of molten para-toluidine at 55 degrees C
(melting point 44 degrees C) had a faulty pump connected to the bottom
run-off line. A fitter removed the main body of the pump for repair.
For physical isolation of the pump housing, the fitter relied on a
single valve and a frozen plug of para-toluidine behind the valve, as
the steam had been removed from the tracing to this line, to seal the
contents. Shortly after the fitter left, the tank contents were
released due to the failure of this isolation. The para-toluidine
overflowed the bund wall and spread over the tank farm, contaminating a
wide area with a solid layer of toxic material. The site emergency team
tried to stop the tank emptying but failed despite their various
efforts.",component/machinery failure/malfunction,operator error,"organized procedures

When subsequently inspected the pipeline was also found to have significant internal scale, which in some places completely blocked the line. It appears that approximately 2 years before the incident the line was subjected to a hydrotest using water. It is now thought that the line contained scale from previous operations and this scale became wet as a result of the hydrotest. The drying procedures rely on any water in the system being driven to low points by the circulation of hydrocarbons, where the water is collected and subsequently drained. However this relies on flow through the plant and linework. Since the failed line was on the discharge of a pressure relief valve (PRV), there would be no flow. It is therefore suspected that the line was still wet when taken back into service.The presence of this water, together with the 0.3% Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) in the Isobutane (iC4) process stream, is thought to have caused the accelerated corrosion and scaling.",corrosion/fatigue,,design of plant/equipment/system,,,"Causes - Plant/Equipment

There is therefore nothing new to be learned with regard to this particular issue. However the company claim that the way the corrosion developed, eventually causing the failure, was unforeseen and therefore there are implications for the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) strategy it employs. The RBI methodology has been reviewed. The company has also had to review the hydrotest and drying procedures. The failed pipeline has been completely replaced and new arrangements provided for the pipeline to be dried at future shutdowns.

Wind speed = 2m/sec (data given by the company).The accident occurred between 11:40 and 11:50 a.m. at the upper level of the building at the pesticide plant, in the water-bath used for pre-heating barrels of raw materials. The pre-heating at 40ö50oC of the contents of the barrels was carried out by means of hot water, which in turn was directly heated by steam supplied by a steam coil (the coil diameter was 5 cm whilst the diameter of the holes of the coil was 0.5 cm). According to the standard operating procedures, the operator had to be always present in the installation and to control the temperature of the raw material. The temperature control had to be carried out by checking the water temperature by means of a hand thermometer and by switching-off the steam valve. The heating of the water was allowed for a period of 2ö2.5 hours as maximum, since long operating experience had shown that this period of time was sufficient to reach a raw material temperature of about 40oC. The day of the accident dimethoate (14 barrels each containing 124 Kg of material) and parathion-methyl (6 barrels each containing 260 Kg of material) had to be heated. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve of the line heating up the water of the bath. Thus, the heating time of the water of the bath and the barrels was extended for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels containing dimethoate. As a result of the explosion (probably due to the friction between the caps and the bodies of the barrels), a fire of dimethoate occurred with subsequent emission of NOx, SOx and mercaptans. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps in other six barrels containing dimethoate. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water (because its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plsnt was not adequate), the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone.

The overheating of the water-bath caused the detonation of the caps in three barrels (each containing 125 kg of dimethoate) and afterwards a fire. The fire was then followed by the detonation of the caps of other six barrels containing dimethoate.

CAUSES:
When the Original Report was prepared, the accident was under juridical investigation. At that moment, the current analysis of causes was the following:
According to the process specification and to the standard operating procedures, the pre-heating of the dimethoate was carried out in the water-bath at 40 - 50 degrees Celsius with a residence time of 2 - 2.5 hours. Despite of the standard operating instructions, the operator forgot to switch-off the valve of the steam heating up the water of the bath, thus extending residence / heating time for at least one hour. As a result of the overheating, the overpressure generated by the vapours production in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels.Further uninvestigation revealed that:Despite of the standard operating instructions for the pre-heating of dimethoate, the operator forgot to switch-off the steam valve (codes 5303 and 5401) heating up the water of the bath and the overpressure, due to the vapours produced in the closed barrels, caused the detonation of the caps of three barrels (code 5102).

567,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The accident occurred at 7:20 a.m. during the shift change. The explosion was caused by the ignition of a vapor cloud of hydrocarbons (light naphtha, propane and butane). The possible source of the hydrocarbons release was the rupture of a 10"" pipe at the bottom of the Naphtha Stabilizer Tower. For about 1 - 1.5 minutes the cloud spread in a large area of the unit and was then ignited by some sources of ignition, exploding. The cloud explosion was then followed by a fire that was confined to the point where the leakage occurred and was totally extinguished at 11.20 a.m. There was an immediate information to the refinery fire brigade and the other refinery  (there is an agreement among the three Refineries to help one each other in case of accident). Five minutes later, the fire vehicles started arriving to Refinery Installations. Totally, there were 23 fire vehicles and 150 firemen plus the personnel of the refinery. One man was killed by the explosion and 33 people hospitalized with burns on their skin. When the Original Report was prepared 14 people had died (the other 13 died in the hospitals because of the burns).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,"gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air

576,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"After the due consideration of the contradictions, the probable scenario of the accident can be summed up as follows:On the territory of the organic substances establishment of BV Rt in the storage farm for inorganic substances, hydrogen fluoride tank no. 3 (hereinafter HF3) had to be prepared for the inspection by the boiler inspector. The first phase of the preparation is the purging of the empty tank through an adsorption system, while being heated by means of an external pipe bundle. This phase was carried out from 27/09/2005 to 30/09/2005 in the morning. On September 30, 2005 one of the the shifts has started the morning shift. The shift leader assigned his workers to different jobs and establishments at the start of the shift. The plant manager starting to work at 7.30 a.m., after getting preliminary information, instructed shift leader ; to carry out the mechanical works at storage tank HF3 as a task of priority.Discussing the manpower need for this job, plant manager told to shut down the mono-nitrating plant and after finishing-off the ongoing charge, also the shutdown of fluorination plant no. 2 and he was of opinion that the manpower released in this way would be sufficient for the execution of the task. Shift leader, after the decision made by the plant manager, had the mono-nitrating plant shut down. He first sent the workers from there to the foreman to pick up tools and special protective equipment and then the workers had to contact plant manager for further assignments. Shift leader did not clearly interpret the instructions he received from the plant manager with regard to the operation of fluorination plant no.2, because he has dismissed one of the operators from there and sent him to help with the mechanical works and he did not give clear instructions to the other operator to start a new charge or to stop the operation either. The preparations of the mechanical works related to tank HF3 came to an end at about 8 o'clock. Mechanical works started under the on-site supervision and management of plant manager. Neither the plant manager, nor the workers actually involved in the works deemed it necessary to wear special protective equipment. Simultaneously with the mechanical works the actual process steps of the charge introduced in the night shift at the fluorination plant were going on. Upon the completion of those steps the operator of fluorination plant no. 2 has started to feed a new charge with HF feed, as he interpreted the instructions given by the plant manager that the plant did not need to be shut down, he was only instructed to pay more attention during the handling of the HF-valves.At about 9.00 o'clock a.m 3 works from the team carrying out the mechanical works have started to relocate a pipeline section (about 6 m long) dismantled earlier. The later victim held one end of this pipeline section in his hands. During lifting he was at the free nozzle that was connected to the HF measurement off-gas pipeline of the 2nd fluorination plant. Probably the operator of the fluorination plant no. 2 has finished the feed of HF from the measuring drum and has started the depressurization of the space inside of the drum by that time.Gases saturated with HF released trough the free nozzle have contacted the face and the upper body of the later victim. After recognizing the accident his colleagues have immediately escorted the injured to the emergency shower close to the scene, where they have showered his upper body and then at the first-aid point on the 1st floor they washed off the injured body part with Ca-lactate solution. Then they have transported the worker to the emergency room of the company doctor by forklift truck. The call center operator, on the basis of the information received from the shift leader, informed the paramedics at 9.05 who transported the injured at 9.30 from the territory of BV Rt. into the hospital. The plant manager being close to the scene when recognizing the accident has blocked the open off-gas valve of the HF measuring drum at fluorination plant no. 2. With this movement the release of gases saturated with HF through the free pipe nozzle into the atmosphere was terminated. Note: at a distance of about 0.5 m from the pipe end, in the same off-gas pipeline, there is a shut-off valve that was, on the basis of the information received from the plant manager in the course of the on-site inspection, not blocked in the moment when the accident happened and it was the plant manager who has blocked it after the accident.  ;",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,,,,,,,01.

582,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The accident involved a reactor used to oxidize a pyridine compound with hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide. The reaction was recognised to be exothermic; therefore, hydrogen peroxide was added at controlled rates. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide plug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For 
further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was emitted into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area when the accident occurred, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist. They were quickly drenched under an emergency shower and suffered no side-effects. No plants were damaged in the accident.
The oxidation reactor was located in a process room dedicated to the synthesis of 2-chloropyridine with 70% hydrogen peroxide using a maleic anhydride catalyst to form a pyridine-N-oxide. ; The reaction was recognized to be exothermic. It was controlled by the rate of addition of the peroxide to a well stirred mixture of the catalyst in pyridine compound. The required peroxide for each batch was transferred from bulk storage to an intermediate holding tank. This tank was located on the ground floor process area and the peroxide was pumped into the reactor via a flow meter. The pyridine was pumped into the reactor from 200 litres drums. The catalyst was added from 50 kg bags through the man-hole. The safety features for this exothermic reaction included: circulation of the reactor contents through two heat exchangers during oxidation; a 200 cm pressure relief line to atmosphere with a 0.7 bar bursting disc; a water quench tank located 3 metres above the reactor, which would automatically dump its contents into the reactor should a sudden temperature increase (&gt; 3°C) occur. The peroxide addition pump would not operate if: the quench tank was not full; the circulation pump was not operating; the reactor's vent was not open to the atmopshere. On the morning of the accident, the chemical operator added the pyridine compound, the catalyst and a peroxide slug (12% of total to be added). The plug was added quickly to the reactor by opening valves 4 and 5 on the by-pass transfer line. For further peroxide addition, valves 4 and 5 had to be closed and valves 1, 2 and 3 and flow meter F1 opened. The flow meter controlled the rate of peroxide addition at 4.5 kg per minute. A few minutes after the peroxide addition had commenced, the operator in the control room observed the reaction temperature to increase suddenly and resulted in a runaway reaction. Although the quench tank was automatically activated, an explosion occurred a short time later and the whole reactor contents was released. Most of the contents was released into the process area through the reactor man-hole cover, which was covered with an aluminium foil disc which would burst at 0.14 bar. The remaining contents was released to the atmosphere through the pressure relief line. As no operators were working in the process area, no one was injured but 3 construction people working 30 metres away were showered by a fine spray mist.

583,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The operation of the plant was organized in two shifts. Since the hydrogenation at Reactor 6 would have taken at least 30 hours, it was not possible to complete the reaction during a single shift. The reaction was commenced at 8:00 a.m. on the day of the accident and, at 11:50 p.m., the shift chemical operator closed down the system as follows:
- he shut off the hydrogen addition at the reactor and closed the valve at the hydrogen cylinder bank;
- the reactor's agitator was turned off and the reactor was left isolated with an hydrogen atmosphere over the liquid.
No nitrogen inerting was used. The operator checked the reactor's control panel which showed normal operating temperature and pressure. The operator was also in control of Reactor 5 which he shut down in a similar manner. At approximately midnight, as the chemical operators were changing in their locker room, they heard a loud explosion coming from the process area. As they evacuated the building, they observed a fire around Reactor 6. The area sprinkler system was automatically activated and quenched the fire. It was noticed that one operator was missing. He came to the assembly point a few minutes later and said that when the explosion occurred he was trapped in the mill room weighing finished product. He could not exit by the process area and had to exit through a hatch on the floor, jump onto a rotary dryer below and climb down to the ground floor. A second explosion occurred a few minutes later. A fire with a characteristic black smoke resulted, indicative of a solvent fire. The sprinkler system extinguished this fire. A short while later, the fire services arrived and put out small localized fires on the ground floor around Reactor 6. The building was left vacant for the rest of the night.

An analysis of the Reactor 6 contents showed that approximately 400 litres of the total contents (about 1200 litres) remained inside the vessel. A quality control analysis of this material showed that the reaction was progressing satisfactorily before the incident. Examinations have shown that combustion should be supported inside the reactor as nitrous oxide was generated in the process. An electrostatic discharge could have caused the first explosion but this was considered unlikely on investigation. The most probable cause of the incident was a defective agitator. The maintenance record on the agitator showed that it malfunctioned on numerous occasions  but the maintenance was not sufficient. It was felt that the agitator possibly malfunctioned again allowing a hydrogen leak. As the reactor was located in a general process area with plants operating nearby, the released hydrogen could easily have found an ignition source as some of the electrical plants operating nearby were not suitable for use with hydrogen. The investigation showed that the reactor's pressure relief line did not operate as the bursting disc was found to be intact.

About 60 kg of hydrogen contained in the gas initially released formed an unconfined vapour cloud and exploded. The explosion was audible up to 2.5 km from the factory and it caused considerable alarm to the residents. Lengths of pipe on either sides of the rupture were displaced as a result of the depressurization. An 8 m length pipe downstream rotated upon itself of about 380° while a 12 m length pipe upstream rotated of about 90°. This 12 m section damaged the pipes on an adjacent pipe-rack rupturing the vent header from the desulphurizer unit and causing the release of approximately 600 kg of methane. The hydrogen released from the upstream section of the 24"" pipe subsequently burned as a jet-fire about 70 m long. The released methane initially burned as a cloud (60 m long) and then as a jet-fire from the ruptured vent header. On hearing the explosion and by the indications from the plant instrumentation of a major leak, the plant operator shut-off the supply of natural gas to the plant and shut-down the individual units.

The ruptured pipe caused further damages resulting in release and ignition of methane and in the release of a small amount of ammonia that dispersed harmlessly.CAUSES:Metallurgical examination of the 24"" pipe showed that a fatigue failure occurred, induced by thermal cycling. Examination of the fracture faces of the ruptured seam weld showed a significant amount of fatigue cracking initiating at the bore of the pipe along a length of about 3 metres of the weld downstream the water injection point. At the upstream end, the rupture propagated circumferentially around the pipe as a shear failure. At the other end, the rupture arrested at a circumferential weld and then propagated as a circumferential tear in the pipe material. The spray pattern from the nozzle was such that water at 80°C was intermittently hitting the inner surface of the pipe and quickly cooling the surface. The process gas stream at a temperature of 230°C quickly heated up the pipe wall again only for it to be quickly cooled by water impingement at the start of the next cycle. This phenomenon which affected a number of areas in the pipe wall downstream of the water injection nozzle caused a number of small fatigue cracks which ultimately developed so that the material near the longitudinal weld failed. Subsequent examination of the spray nozzle showed that this may have been distorted for some time prior to the accident causing preferential impingement possibly enhancing the failure mechanism although it is not concluded that this distortion was the main cause of the failure. There was a two year history of previous leaks in welds further downstream on this section of pipe which it is now recognized were due to the same cause. At the time the company wrongly diagnosed the cause as external stress corrosion cracking.The accident occurred due to the rupture of a 24"" pipe (code 5102) caused by a cyclic fatigue corrosion (code 5104). The cyclic fatigue corrosion was induced by thermal cycling. The underlying causes that led to the corrosion of the pipe were: a plant design inadequate (code 5308), insufficient maintenance procedures (code 5313) and an inadequate management attitude problem (5302) because it failed to clarify the causes of previous accidents.","component/machinery failure/malfunction

The roof of the pilot plant was destroyed. The factory is in an industrial estate on basically level ground. The day was dry with calm conditions. Smoke from the fires drifted towards a nearby town about 2 km away. The 450 l glass lined reactor was built in 1979 according to B.S. 1500. It was tested and certified in 1980 and installed in 1980.

Taking also into account witnesses who heard a first big explosion and a few seconds later two other more suffocated explosions, it was deduced that most likely the empty tank No 43 exploded first causing the explosions of tanks No 44 and 45. The explosions of tanks No 44 and 45 were followed by the fire of the contained methanol. Tank No 42 was also partially damaged because of the explosion of the adjacent No 43: it was still emitting hexane vapours during the inspection. Probably the explosion was caused by the ignition of a mixture of residual methanol vapours with air formed during the degassing operations of tank No 43 (it was degassed with air in order to recover nonane). When the explosion occurred, five workers were working on degassing operations: after the accident, three dead bodies had been recovered and another worker was missed (his lifeless body was found a few days later). On the basis of the positions in which their bodies were found, they were presumably on top of the tank No 43, near to an open man-hole. The last worker, heavily injured, had been found in the pump-room and was hospitalized. According to Carmagnani's officials the tank's cleaning was considered a routine operation: depending on the substances to remove, water or air were used for cleaning purposes. In case of purging with water, washing water gathered by a draining system was conveyed to a waste-water treatment plant. In case that two incompatible substances had to be loaded subsequently into the same tank, purging with air was used (air was pumped in the vessel through a man-hole and was discharged from other openings). This situation occurred for tank No 43 because methanol residues were considered incompatible with nonane that had to be stored. All purging operations were normally carried out without neither nitrogen protection nor by monitoring the surrounding environment for the presence of flammable gases. No fixed explosimeter or smoke detectors were installed but the operators could make use of portable explosimeters and personal protection devices (breathing apparatuses, filters, masks). The first aid room was equipped with stretches and medical supplies and fire extinguishers were placed as laid down under the Fire Brigade's Regulations.

595,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"The day of the accident, preparative works for the decennial pneumatic test on request of the U.S.L. 12 (previous pneumatic test was carried out in 1978) were started on one out of the seven reactors for ammonia synthesis. The reactor was put out of service and a slow pressurization with process gases (hydrogen and nitrogen) was carried out at ambient temperature. It was necessary to carry out many pneumatical cycles of pressurization and depressurization because of leaks from some flanges. After any cycle, the bolts of the flanges were tightened and a purging with nitrogen at 8 ate was carried out. Finally, a slow pressurization (20 minutes before the explosion occurred the internal pressure was about 250 kg/cm2 at a temperature of about 20-30°C) with process gases was in progress at ambient temperature when, suddenly, an explosion occurred. 3 people were operating inside the plant when the explosion occurred: 1 of them was killed and a second one was in a state of shock. The explosion destroyed the upper part of the column and metallic parts of the reactor were thrown in a radius of many metres around it. It also caused the complete destruction of the building where the reactor was located. After the accident, on-site arrived the local fire brigade and the police.

Initially, a strong whistle from this tank had been noticed but it was supposed to be a steam leak. Repair of the steam duct had been organized. The operators sent on the top of the tank for the repair works noticed a cloud with a yellow-green colour escaping from the tank and gave the alarm. A large fire developped and a strong explosion occurred 6 or 7 minutes after the whistle was noticed. Combustion products of cyclohexanone and dimethoate together with the toxic substances from the insulating and plastic materials of the nearby pipings, structures and plants involved in the fire were released into the environment. Due to the explosion, the front bottom part of the tank was thrown towards the Rogor plant and the remaining part, as a missile, against the reinforced concrete wall of the control room about 45 m away. The fire that followed the explosion had been extinguished by water-sprays in about 20 minutes with the intervention of the plant firemen and the National Fire Brigade. Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps), a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the sea. Prohibition of bathing followed. The degree of pollution of the air, soil and water due to the release of toxic substances and combustion products as well as the fire extinguishing water were continuously controlled (the results of these checks are shown in a document attached to the Original Report).

597,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"On August 23, 1988 during a period in which the plant was out of operation as requested by the authority the 23/07/88, a certain quantity of an aqueous ammonia solution flowed in the water drain network of the establishment and through it to the Bormida's river. The overflow occurred in the storage tank SR-41 collecting a 3% aqueous ammonia solution from the amination plant. At 04:30 a.m. the high level alarm of tank SR-41 sounded. The operators intervened and identified the cause of the malfunction, eliminating it at about 06:30 a.m. The overflow of ammonia was caused by the opening (it is not yet fully clear how it could had been happened) of the pneumatic valve FV-1 that was feeding with water the scrubber tower which treats releases from the safety valves of the amination autoclaves. During the event neither gaseous release nor damage to people and properties occurred. Ammonia levels of 25 mg/l (maximum allowable value was 15 mg/l) were measured by U.S.L.

The accidental opening of the pneumatic valve (air-open type) with emission of water in the scrubber tower which collected the releases of the safety valves of the amination autoclaves, led to the release of an ammonia solution from tank SR-41.

CAUSES:
The water feeding to the scrubber tower was controlled by the pneumatic valve FV-1 that received the opening signal by the flow and pressure sensors positioned on the draining pipes to the tower. As the water gathered on the bottom of the scrubber tower reached a pre-fixed level, the electrical pump PC-2 started sending water into the tank SR-41 via the intermediate tank SA-11b. When the accident occurred, the valve FV-1 was positioned on ""AUTO"" and the autoclaves were opened and empty. A flow meter set-point was wrongly positioned to the maximum sensitivity and it could have caused, for a not clear reason, the opening of the valve with emission of water in the scrubber tower.  Due to an inadequate process analysis and plant design, the overflow piping from tank SR-41 was connected to drain network of the establishment and the ammonia solution, through it, was released into the Bormida's river. About 30 m3 of ammonia solution overflowed during two hours.

598,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"The accident occurred in one of the two glass lined storage tanks, 35 m3 capacity each, holding the recirculated acid solution (about 29% of sulphuric acid) used to absorb the residual ammonia from the gaseous effluents of the phtalocyamines process unit. This solution was enriched with ammonium carbonate coming from the ammonia treatment unit. The pH of the solution was manually controlled once per shift and adjusted if necessary by adding sulphuric acid solution so that the pH was maintained within the slightly acidic range (5 to 6). The solution's pH was periodically checked (every 8 hours) by an operator. When the accident occurred, the operator realized too late that the ammonium sulphate and ammonium carbonate solution was became basic and suddenly added a 60% sulphuric acid solution to it. This resulted in an abnormal production of carbon dioxide that overpressurized the tank which exploded because of inadequate pressure relieving capacity (the hydraulic trap with which the tank was equipped was not sufficient to withstand the peak pressure generated). The collapse of the tank caused the release of the solution (about 20 m3), which was partially recovered in the containment basin of the 2 glass lined tanks and partially in the yard. The rest of the solution was collected, through the sewer network, in the emergency basin of ACNA. All plants (except power plant and the oleum production plant) were shut-down in order to reduce the amount of effluents to the sewer network. This allowed the depuration of the ammonia solution released from the exploded tank and accumulated in the emergency basin avoiding, therefore, the pollution of the Bormida river.

The oven has two radiant chambers and a convection zone. In the two chambers the combustion of the fuel oil for the heating of the input distillates circulating in the tubes surrounding the chamber occurs. The convection zone also has various series of tubes. The first indication of a malfunction was an anomalous temperature increase (+6 degrees Celsius) observed on the thermal element in the oven output.

NAMED SUBSTANCE","The accident originated from the rupture of a tube, located about 3/4 of the height in the first pass in the combustion chamber (side ""Ancona""), and later involved other two tubes, one in the same chamber and another down in the convection chamber. In a first internal report of the company two hypothesis were put forward: either partial obstruction of the tube passage due to an anomalous detaching of the coke, which 
normally forms a layer inside the tube, or a defect of the material of the tube at the point of the rupture. From the successive analysis of temperature of the tube passages and the product flows, the technical note supports as the most plausible hypothesis the material defect of the tube which was the origin of the first loss, and which would not have been evident during the normal operation of the plant.
The hypotheses put forward on the accident causes (material defect or less probable, anomalous detachment of coke with partial obstruction of the tube) permit the following considerations. The ruptured tube was in the zone of maximum opening of the flame that is under greater thermal stress: this reinforces the hypothesis of the existence of a tube defect in this zone. As far as the possible coke detachment is concerned, the scientific literature says that in the visbreaking processes of the refineries there are undesired phenomena of asphaltenes precipitation due to incompatibility between the supply load and the derived products. These agglomeration phenomena are facilitated by the increase of the severity of the visbreaking process.

In the first phase a local fire occurred near the atmospheric vessel called TK103, containing a solution of NaOH in water of the RT1 plant (revamping topping) and used for neutralizing the acidity of the raw oil contained in the desalter of the TK2 plant. The fire caused damage to the tank and to the electrical cables running near the vessel. This fire has been definitively extinguished at 9.25. In the second phase at 9.45, an explosion occurred at the exit of the tube from the preheating oven (F301) of gasoil + H2 of the desulphurisation plant.

a human error, during the manual operation of the dilution of the sodium hydroxide 
solution (routine operation), protracted for an excessive time, leading to the overflow 
and emission of hydrocarbons in the canals and their flushing shafts collecting white 
waters. The overflowing hydrocarbons reached the zone in which workers performed 
the welding. The following fire and the extinguishing operations caused the activation 
of the protection devices of the grounding system, which resulted in interruption of the 
electrical supply. Such interruption provoked the gasoil supply loss in the oven F301 in 
which the second accident occurred.  The increase in the temperature and pressure 
inside the pipes in which gasoil + H2 should have circulated occurred due to this 
supply loss, with consequent overheating of the pipes resulting in rupture and 
explosion.  Also in this case, a human error can be reasonably presumed, based on the 
available computerised registrations, consisting of the undue silencing of alarms due to 
insufficient supply and of high temperature and pressure and the subsequent omitted

make the procedures of the training more stringent, repeating them at regular intervals, 
as well as the updating of the responsible personnel to the operations in the plant, 
even for operation considered ""routine"", emphasising the necessity of following to 
the rule, the instructions received and above all the written procedures.
Another consideration consists of the opportunity of making more rigid the security 
processes prescribed for the modification and /or improvement of the plants, in 
particular when external companies are used, when theses operations take place in 
the vicinity of functioning plants, or with operations under work (routine or not), 
adopting a more stringent system for the working permits.
However, because the experience teaches that human errors can happen, although everything is always possible, it would be opportune that some key interventions at the end of the functioning of the security of the plants can not be bypassed, ignored or silenced by the responsible personnel (blockage devices, alarms of extreme intervention, etc.).

This water, which contains traces of hydrocarbons, is normally sent to the treatment plant to have the hydrocarbon concentration reduced to the level at which it is permitted to discharge to waste water.According to the company management, the hydrocarbons normally lie at the top of the tank, with a maximum depth of about 10 cm. - which corresponds to a quantity of c. 20 m3. At the time of the accident, there was a depth of 3.4 m. of hydrocarbons, corresponding to a volume of 680 m3. For reasons which the company are still investigating, some hydrocarbon had been released from the tank, presumably from the vent on the floating roof. Apparently some of this material was then carried to the base of the tank by the internal drainage pipes. The tank does not have a retention cuvette.The vaporisation of the hydrocarbons led to the formation of some 60m. of vapour cloud, which extended to the nearby Provincial road Arquata Scrivia - Vignole B.According to witnesses, the cloud was ignited by the passage of two lorries.

621,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"The overpressure ; caused by an unforeseen runaway reaction between ; chlorinated tars and TDI caused the explosion of Tank no. D 528/2 and a subsequent fire. The pressure wave ; and the carbon dioxide formed by the explosion of the second tank no. D 528/1 extinguished most fires which had developed.The accident occurred in a section of high-boiling tars of the TDI department TD5. In the department TD5 toluene di-isocyanate (TDI) is produced through the reaction of 2,4-toluendiamine (TDA) and phosgene.The reaction is performed in 3 successive steps with increasing temperature from approximately 80°C to 170°C, with decreasing pressure and hydrogen chloride acid as a by-product.In the section of high-boiling tars, described in the attached block-diagram (ref. Attachment 2), a part of TDI is recovered in a vacuum batch process from the mixture containing 50% TDI and 50% ; high-boiling tars, stored in tank D 522, which is equipped with a stirrer and water refrigerated coils.The TDI is recovered by evaporation in the concentrator D 525/1, equipped with a stirrer, steam heated coils and maintained at vacuum pressure.Concentrator D 525/1 is fed by the tanks D 528/1-2-3 acting also as compensation tanks. The TDI vapours are then condensed and the liquid then transferred for storage, the residual gas is sent through a separator and then suctioned by the 3stage vacuum units P 509/1-3. The concentrate present in D 525/1 is composed of 18-20% TDI and for the remaining part of high-boiling tars is diluted with toluene, mixed and transferred over a pump in tank D 541, where it is continuously stirred at a temperature of 115 - 120°C with the objective of obtaining a sufficiently fluid and stable mass to be sent into the incinerator B 502/2 for combustion.On 26/11/2002 at about 17:40 the shift assistant of ; department TD 4-5 shut down the stirrer P 507 of tank D 522 due to the excessive noise of the reduction gear of the motor caused by an insufficient lubrication (memo in the logbook).Following the shutting down of the stirrer P 705 the temperature in tank D 544 started to rise gradually and stabilised at 125°C according to the value recorded by the DCS (Distributed Control System) switchboard assistant. These values cannot be considered ; reliable due to the fact that the instrument T 5-258 was calibrated to measure temperatures up to 120°C. Tank D 522 receiving the high-boiling tars and the TDI from the evaporator D 521 operates at a maximum temperature of approximately 95°C in normal operating conditions.On 27/11/2002 at 7:30 hrs the feed to tank D 522 is reduced from 400 kg/h to 1900 kg/h maintaining the water circulation in the cooling coils of tank D 522 constant. The reduction of the feed charge reduced the temperature in tank D 522 to 65°C. At approximately 12:00 hrs on 27/11/2002 the temperature of tank D 522 rose again in connection with the increased load of the evaporator D 521, which went up from the previous 1700 kg/h to 7000 kg/h. For the remaining part of 27/11/2002 and until approximately 17:30 hrs on 28/11/2002, when the stirrer was started again, the DCS registered a temperature beyond the top of the measurement scale (above 120°C). At 4:00 hrs on 28/11/2002 the shift personnel registered a temperature rise in tanks D528/1-2-3 and on the work sheet the temperature marked for tanks D 528/1-2-3 were respectively 136-142 and 131°C. The operating temperature normally foreseen for the tanks is 105°C.The switchboard operator reported to the shift assistant an abnormal batch distillation, characterised by the rapidity of the same and the low amount of distilled product, the temperature of D 525/1 was 139°C instead of 105-110° expected at the beginning of the distillation.The operation manual did not indicate the measures to be adopted in case of high temperatures in D 522 and D 528/1-2-3.In the meantime, at 16:30 on 28/11/2002 tank 528/2 filled to 60% reached the temperature of 170°C.The design temperature of the equipment D528/1-2-3 is 150°C.At 18:00 hrs the temperature in tank D 528/2 reached 181°C and it was not possible to discharge tank D 528/2 because distillation was in progress in D25/1 and tank D541 feeding the incinerator B 502/2 was full and could not receive the high-boiling tars from D 525/1.Only at 18:35, when the distillation process in D 525/1 finished, could the discharge into D 541 be performed, only at this point did D 541 have the capacity to receive the content of D 525/1.At 18:50 valve XV 5316 was opened to start the discharge operation of tank 528/2 into tank D 525/1; in that point tank D 528/2, with a nominal capacity of 10m3, was 59.5% full and the temperature ; 220.7°C. The attempt to discharge tank D 528/2 did not succeed, due to the fact that the not homogenous product inside the tank contained solid matter which blocked the discharge of the tank. Inside the tank unwanted chemical reactions had been going on for hours with development of gas and increase of the temperature and viscosity of the reaction mass.Four external contractors approached the distillation unit D 525/1 to verify the conditions inside the unit through a visual inspection window installed on the dome cap. A dense white smoke inside the distillation unit did not allow the workers to look inside the equipment and the pipe connecting tank D 528/2 to the rupture disk was particularly hot. At 19:25 a second attempt to discharge the tank was made but failed, the temperature on the control panel indicated 220°C while there was no means to measure the pressure inside the vessel. At 19:30 the four external contractors were still in the plant verifying the hydraulic guard D 583 when a strong whistling was heard and white smoke leaking from the flanged coupling located on the delivery tube of the distillation unit D 525/1 was seen. Instinctively the four external contractors tried to escape but a strong explosion was heard, at 19:42 hrs tank D 528/2 exploded. The tank contained a mixture of TDI and TDI high-boiling tars. The pressure wave of the explosion made one escaping worker fall while all were hit and covered by a dense, warm, half solid substance with a high viscosity and a granular structure. After a few (dozen) seconds a fire developed.The explosion ignited a fire involving the terminal part (southern side) of the framework of the ""TDI high-boiling tars processing"" department. The fire was mainly fed by 20 tons of diathermic oil (Aerthem 320) and one ton of toluene due to the rupture of the corresponding pipes.The fire affected the second of the three TDI and high-boiling tars storage tanks, D 528/1 (85% full when the accident occurred), causing its mechanical failure and releasing the second explosion at approximately 20:25 hrs.

When the event occurred the tank was filled to 60% of its design capacity of 10 m3.A study has been performed by the Dow, on the thermal stability of the substances involved in the accident and in particular on the results of the adiabatic calorimetric tests (ARC) performed on a tar sample collected immediately after the accident from tank D 522, with the goal of understanding the behaviour of the substances involved in the accident.The tests were made by heating a known quantity of material composed by high-boiling tars and TDI in an adiabatic thermal system and registering the temperature and pressure evolution over time. This test simulated the heating process of the product in D 528/2 involved in the explosion. The test results agree basically with the values registered by the DCS during the accident and demonstrated the development of two distinct reactions, one exothermic reaction and another one developing carbon dioxide.The rupture disk failed due to a plug formed of hardened foam of the ""boiling"" mass on the pipe connecting the tank with the rupture disk and the venting manifold.","component/machinery failure/malfunction

LPP (Loss Prevention Programme) Guidelines for the analysis of the compliance of the process with the accident prevention principles.This methodology was developed by the technological centre of the company based on the experience gained in the establishments of Dow and other major companies operating worldwide.The compliance with these guidelines allows the performance in terms of safety and operating reliability in general to be improved.These guidelines often reflect the entire experience and knowledge gained on the management of process plants and the process anomalies that may occur in any of the activities involved in the management of a chemical plant (design, process control, operation, safety procedures, equipment).Analysis of the management systems of the combustion plants.As for the foregoing guidelines this tool is used inside the company to compare the combustion systems (heating furnaces, steam generators) with the most advanced technologies in the field of safety and reliability.During the audit the problems concerning the management of the furnaces, the safety systems (alarms, shut-down systems), the control systems and the process parameters were analysed, using the most advanced international standards as reference and complying with Italian and European norms.- Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)The LOPA analysis is a simplified form of risk analysis that analyses the risk of an undesired event over the magnitude of the event frequencies, effect gravity and event probability.The LOPA process builds a risk analysis process using all data available from the Dow technological centre, from the databases of the company, from the plant histories and using the specific knowledge of the process engineers of the plants (from Dow or other companies).The analysis demonstrates that the implemented safety systems are adequate to obtain acceptable risk levels.- Investigation into the problems concerning chemical reactivityAll aspects concerning chemical reactivity of the substances present in the TDI production cycle were examined very closely; product incompatibilities and eventual instabilities were analysed.Chemical reactivity matrices and reference guidelines, based on Dow's experience, have been issued for the personnel of all Dow installations and in particular for those producing isocyanates.A detailed analysis was ; performed on the reactivity of TDI and high-boiling tar mixtures with respect to different parameters, such as temperature, residence time and composition, referring also to the accident that occurred in November 2002.Paragraph 2.4 lists the studies carried out, these studies have been used to increase the safety of various sections.-Definition of Process Safety Cardinal RulesDevelopment and implementation of the cardinal rules concerning the process safety during production of dinitrotoluene, toluene di-amine, toluene di-isocyanate and phosgene.These rules have been developed based on the experience of Dow and other leading companies gained in plant management; the rules indicate in a clear and concise way the criticality of different process phases, pointing out the operations to be avoided, with the goal of operating at the highest safety levels.- Pre start-up Audit As foreseen by the procedures of the company an audit was performed on the plant to check if there were the necessary safety conditions to restart the plant following the recent shut-down for maintenance.The audit was carried out on the entire plant with particular attention on the high-boiling tars processing section upstream the introduction of chemical reagents in the process; the ; performance of all foreseen test procedures on equipment and piping subject to maintenance was audited, and adequate training of the operative plant personnel was verified with specific checklists.The implementation of the procedures contained in the operative manual was verified with a particular focus on the safety standards.- Updating of the operative manualThe entire operative manual of the department was revised, not only with regards to the high-boiling tars treatment section, which was the main reason of the revision, but also for all departments of the plant.- Management of change (MoC)All technical or procedural changes have to be assessed through a MoC procedure analysing the consequences of the change with specific checklists with the participation of all roles involved.When the present report was issued, it was foreseen that by the time ; modifications were operative ; the operating procedures for the modified plant would also be available and the training of the personnel would have been concluded"
622,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"At 15:03 hrs in the isomerisation unit a mechanical rupture in one out of two compressors occurred. The compressors, which were working in parallel and were operating at a pressure of 20 bars, were dedicated to conveying the gas mixture needed for the isomerisation process. The rupture caused the release of a gas mixture containing hydrogen, which on coming into contact with air ignited forming a jet fire. The jet fire headed towards the adjacent benzene saturation (BenSat) section hitting the nearest equipment (a pressure vessel) located 14 m from the release point. Weakening of the BenSat structure, consequent release of benzene from these structures and extension of the fire, with substantial destruction of the section. The length of the jet-fire could not be calculated with precision because the flame hit against the nearby BenSat unit; if the jet had not been stopped by the BenSat unit, it could have had an estimated length of approximately 30 m.Off-site fire brigade teams intervened extinguishing the fire within approximately 1 hour and a half of work.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","The accident was caused by the mechanical rupture of the bottom of the reciprocating compressor in the isomerisation section. This rupture was probably caused by a failure of the crank mechanism made of piston rod and drive shaft that caused the beating of the piston on the cylinder-bottom of the compressor. The combined effect of the beating and of the operation pressure may have caused the failure of the nuts holding the cylinder bottom; the following energy release threw the cylinder bottom weighing 100 kg approximately 14 meters away.Due to the fact that the process control records did not register significant changes in the process parameters it has to be assumed that the failure of the crank mechanism was caused by aspects linked to maintenance or by a material defect.At time of this report investigations were being performed on the material fragments of the failed crank components. An official systematic investigation on the failure cause with an expert appointed by the court is expected.The clearance in the compressor between piston and cylinder bottom is 3 mm. According to the declarations of the operator, it appears evident that a mechanical interference between cylinder bottom and drive shaft may have occurred.The nuts holding the failed cylinder bottom were found with completely abraded threads whereas the bolts on the contrary were practically undamaged and a few were just slightly blackened.The flammable gas mixture was probably ignited by the beating and the friction of the failed crank mechanism or by an electrostatic charge built up through gas seepage.",component/machinery failure/malfunction,,"supervision

623,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"The accidental event occurred on September 8th 2004 near the Falconara Marittima API Refinery, bitumen loading and storage area, has been characterized by the catastrophic failure of the reservoir TK-145, dedicated to the bitumen storage, the damage of neighboring equipments as other reservoirs, loading platforms, supports of pipelines, other loading tankers (trucks) present in the area during the event. The substances involved in the accident, according to the information so far retrieved, are primarily bitumen and secondarily heavy distillates of refinery (vacuum distilled, named hot-oil), present in a closed loop and used in the reservoir identified as the accident source, as well as in other equipment as heating fluid; as in Directive 96/82/CE bitumen is not classified as a dangerous substance and therefore removed from its field of application, while the vacuum distillate is classified as dangerous substance for the environment with phrases risk R51/53. The most meaningful damage occurred has been concerning the human health, because of the involvement of some tanker drivers in the fire of the hot oil or due to contact with the 170°C hot bitumen; a spreading of bitumen has also been found in the sea water, whose amount ranges from 6 to 30 m3 according to the estimates of the theoretical spread quantity done by the ARPAM, regional Agency for the environmental protection, through a partially buried ditch present in the area of the Refinery affected by the event.The event occurred on the day September 8th 2004 is therefore qualified as a major accident, having a dangerous substance (hot oil) been involved in quantities above the limits established by the Annex VI and having been damages for the human health following fire or contact with high temperature products with one casualty.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,"fluid release to ground

09 ii. DANGEROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT - R51,R53","As of today, based on a preliminary analysis performed by the operations management, 2 possible different scenarios have been identified; these must be verified by means of further checks: 1) TK-145 reservoir inner overpressure originated by explosion of mixtures of light flammable substances present in the reservoir. 2) overpressure produced by rapid expansion of water introduced in the reservoir. Both scenarios can be brought back to either instrumental or equipment breakdowns or to human error/action. Particularly it is believed as possible by the operations management the introduction of light mixtures or water through the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers, used for the reintroduction in the reservoir of an eventual excess of bitumen loaded by the tankers to the platforms. The initiation causes are still under characterization; based on the technical elements so far collected by the firm, the overpressure that has lead to the explosion and the projection of the TK-145 bitumen reservoir may have been triggered by the inlet of water, with consequent rapid phase transition to the 170°C hot temperature of the bitumen reservoir, higher than the boiling temperature, or by the introduction of light compounds with formation of an explosive mixture and blast, originated by the bitumen overload unloading system of the tankers; the validity of such an hypothesis depends upon the results of summarizing all the operations performed in the morning of the accident.

625,Major Accident,Plastic and rubber manufacture,"Fire broke out in a 60 m³-silo half-full of polyurethane dust, in a Seveso-classified plastic insulation panel factory. At approximately 14:00, there was an explosion in a polyurethane panel crusher; its expansion within the silo increased the pressure and one of the outlet vents gave way, causing a second explosion noise. Subsequently a fire broke out, releasing smoke and gas, including carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN). The alarm was set off at 14:05; 80 staff members were evacuated and the internal emergency plan (POI) was deployed. The internal safety teams made use of a factory fire hose and called the external emergency services at 14:15, who arrived between 14:30 and 14:45. The power supplies to the site were cut off and rainwater-network blocking valves were activated.
The police force and gas, electricity and rail service representatives, as well as the deputy mayor and sub-prefect arrived on site. At 15:30, safety representatives evacuated the industrial and commercial zone (26 persons) and restricted movement for 500 local residents. A safety perimeter was established around the site. Fire service officials, equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), cooled the silo with fire hoses. Foam was injected from above. The undertaking does not have any technical drawings of the silo at its disposal. The maximum hydrogen cyanide concentration recorded was 4 ppm, compared with the exposure limit value of 1.9 ppm. The extinguishing water overflowed the retention structure but still remained contained on site, retained by the waterproof external courtyard. At 19:00, power lines were reconnected and one production line resumed operation. The fire was fully extinguished at 22:00. At 01:00 a second production line resumed operation. During the emergency, one firefighter was affected by carbon monoxide. With resources from other departments, a network to measure the level of hydrogen cyanide in the affected area could be set up.
The following day, at approximately 10:00, once the hatch had been opened, SCBA-equipped firefighters emptied the silo from the bottom. This work was then taken over by a private company. The inspectorate responsible for classified facilities attended the scene. The safety services completed their work by 20:00.
There was only limited damage to the site: The cladding panels of a workshop were blackened by smoke and the crusher was slightly damaged; the silo can be repaired. All production lines, which were shutdown for a few hours and which remained intact, resumed operation on 15 November.
The silo in question is used to store two forms of polyurethane dust waste: fine machining dust aspirated off and passed via a bag filter before being transferred to the silo and coarser sawdust particles aspirated off as waste from a polyurethane-panel crusher located directly adjacent to the silo (linked by 20 m of tubing to enable aspiration from the crusher to silo). The dust particles are ultra light, weighing 450 kg per 30 m³. Given the site layout, it is unlikely that the machining section caused the fault (given the intermediary transfer via the filter, the duration of the aspiration process, absence of metal components, etc.). It is probable that the crusher was responsible, considering the fire marks on that device and the fact that crushed panels contain a fine layer of aluminium that could have generated a spark. Moreover, the crushing of panels releases pentane, which can be explosive or flammable under certain conditions, such as, for example, when a crusher heats up. These panels are often the source of fires breaking out in storage containers during crushing. The operator examines these hypotheses in the accident report.
The operator is looking into installing a spark detection system in conjunction with a valve diversion or water sprinkler system. Further measures are envisaged: increasing air dilution in the crusher area, installing pentane detectors, and installing a belt or screw conveyor for the open-air evacuation of crushed panels. The crusher will not resume operation until the completion of corrective and preventative measures, the implementation of which will be monitored at the next meeting of the Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,not known / not applicable,,,not known / not applicable,,,,01.

The shift personnel present onsite and in particular the shift foreman who was staying on the main access ramp to the atmospheric distillation plants, testified that he saw the jet-fire ignite from the top and propagate down (from approx 18m above ground down to approx 14m in the area comprised between the exchangers E1718 A/B/C and the reactor R1702). Immediately the shift foreman activated the onsite emergency plan and informed the gate guard in order to alert the fire brigade. At 21:40 the fire brigade was alerted. The jet fire affected the quench-line with the 3"" hydrogen pipe, which ruptured after 6 min. exposure with the consequent ignition of the hydrogen. The fire took a cylindrical form from the bottom to the top starting at 14 m height affecting above located plant parts, comprising under other the pre-heater of the diathermic oil. Approx 30 minutes after the fire ignited a 8"" fuel pipe of the diathermic oil system ruptured and subsequent ignition of the product. The fire was kept under control and evolved without noticeable changes until consumption of the fuel once the pipes were shut off according to the emergency response plan which had been activated. The fire was extinguished at 1:20 h on 02/09/2005 (3 hours and 40 minutes after the fire initiated) and the state of emergency was called off by the fire brigade at 1:45 h.No damages to persons has been reported consequent to the accident.According to damage evaluations performed, there has not been any environmental damage, this evaluation has been confirmed also by an environmental indicators assessment performed by ARPA of Genoa.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,conflagration (a general engulfment fire),jet flame (burning jet of fluid from orifice),,,,,,"01.

627,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"On 30/04/06 at 14:40 hrs. a plant operator noticed a spot of liquid hydrocarbons (HC) in the trench, in correspondence of the cross point of roads 8 and L, in proximity of the subway of road ex SS114 (sea side). At 15:00 hrs. The leak was localized on a pipeline section 2 m from the subway; in correspondence to road Nr. 9/0; the pipeline connected tank DA1085 in the crude oil tank-farm SG10 with the refinery's topping plant CR20 (as shown in the map included in the records).The company decided to seal the leak by installing a sealing collar on the located rupture point. The workers dismantled the piping insulation (latten and rock wool) in the corresponding pipe section. After the insulation had been dismantled the spill increased with hot hydrocarbons (60° C) spraying downwards towards the subway. The approx. 30 mm long fissure, parallel to the pipe axis presented a 30° angle generating line. A liquid hydrocarbon pool formed and spread at least up to the first detection point due to the slope inclination (some 60 m from the leakage point in the pipe).At 16:10 hrs, the competent authorities for off-site emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the memorandum of understanding signed with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after conclusion of the insulation dismantling operation, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side of the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade, ;- isolation the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure, ;- closure of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade mobilised initially two emergency response vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was generated. At 17:42 hrs the shift commander of the onsite fire brigade alerted the public fire department in Siracusa, once he understood that the fire was out of control.Meanwhile the shift manager called the refinery's emergency response committee and alerted the personnel of Syndial and Polimeri Europa, owners of some of the pipe lines in the affected trench. ;After a few minutes another fire front developed from the entry of the subway in road Nr 9/0 (uphill), also this fire was fought initially by the onsite emergency response services, with other two fire fighting vehicles.At 18:10 hrs The public fire brigade arrived from Siracusa and took the command of the emergency response management.At 18:50 a first BLEVE explosion occurred in another pipeline line containing probably light hydro carbons, and was followed by successive explosions of pipelines in the same trench, all due to the overheating of the products inside the pipeline consequent to the heat irradiation of the fire in the trench.At 18:55 the decision was taken to shut down all installations inside the establishment, as precautionary measureFire extinguishing operations lasted 48 hours, the fire damaged seriously the pipelines uphill and downhill the subway, as well as aerial pipelines passing parallel to the trench or crossing it.

This circumstance has not allowed, according to the technical consultancy report, to verify the compliance with the technical norms on visual tests, inspections and maintenance of the piping system concerned.Concerning the cause of the fire, the company made the supposition that, , the contact between the vapours formed from the spilled hydrocarbons with hot spots of high pressure steam pipes, reaching up to 280° steam temperature, in correspondence of the subway, may have contributed to the expansion of a vapour cloud; the vapour cloud ignited on an ignition source downhill from the subway were the first fire was detected.Concerning the successive BLEVEs, which caused major damage to the persons involved in the emergency response operations, these are related directly to the permanent heat irradiation of the fire (which lasted approx. 48 hrs), which overheated other pipelines containing hydrocarbons also in gas form in the pipe string. Concerning the direct involvement of the company, the same company states that the event may have had less serious consequences if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted immediately at leak detection and not three hours later, as effectively happened.This assumption is confirmed by the technical consultancy report, which affirms that if the onsite fire brigade would have been alerted more rapidly the damages caused by the fire could have been contained.Concerning this aspect it has to be said that the Attorney General's Office is still investigating on the matter.The Human error indicated relates to the faulty application of the Emergency procedures foreseen in the onsite Emergency Plan.The fault during the Repair operation (dismantling of the pipe insulation layer) relates to the failure to adopt appropriate safety measures during the operation.The design fault relates to the inadequate design and rationalisation of the pipe bundle.",corrosion/fatigue,operator error,"training/instruction

Emergency Response","Immediate lessons: ; Critical equipment aspects encountered onsite the establishment immediately after the accident:
- ; ; ; the pipe bundle disposition inside the trench and also inside the
subway was such to cause extreme difficulties during the emergency
response operations;
- ; ; ;  ;there was a large number of closely packed pipes, containing
different kinds of liquids (and in particular hazardous ones), which
were not immediately identifiable and traceable;
- ; ; ; the presence and vicinity in the same bundle of pipes containing
hazardous substances and pipes with high pressure/temperature steam
- ; ; ; mix up of the pipe lay-out of utility pipes (and in particular the
extinguishing water pipe) with the product transfer pipes, this
circumstance has caused the overpressure in the isolated pipe tract
exposed to the heat irradiation from the fire and the consequent
explosion of the pipes and interrupted the extinguishing water supply
from the pipe inside the bundle and damaged also another suspended
extinguishing water pipe crossing the pipe bundle;
- ; ; ; high hold-up levels of the tube bundle, due to the reduced number isolating valves on the pipe-lines;
- ; ; ; inadequate gradient arrangement, absence of retaining curbs and of adequate water drainage systems.

Critical management aspects found: 
- Incomplete compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan: The onsite
fire-brigade was alerted ; only three hours after the crude oil leak
detection.
- age (more than 25 years) and state of conservation of the pipe
triggering the event, with respect to progressive corrosion processes
encountered, which finally caused the leak;.
The company stated that periodical inspections had been performed
according to the technical ""Piping inspection code"" API 570 on the
event triggering pipe;
These periodical inspections were part of the establishment's
maintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection on
the above mentioned pipe had been performed in February 2005. 
Following the accident the company asked the specialist American
company Fluor Daniel to assess the inspection methodology employed by
the company and to propose possible improvements.

The company has realised following structural measures on the installation, with respect to the above mentioned aspects:
- ; ; ; total reconstruction of the pipe bundle over a length of 300 m,
according to a project integrating the requests formulated by the
Technical Regional Committee of Sicily (resolution CTR dated
05/05/2006) and additional considerations formulated by the company.
The reconstruction and modification project was divided in several phases:
- ; ; ; Phase 1: reactivation of the product loading - unloading wharf
- ; ; ; Phase 2: start up of the pipe lines and plant parts which were not damaged or functionally affected by the fire.
- ; ; ; Phase 3: restoration and modification of the damaged pipes

The reconstruction project of the pipe bundle included in particular:
- ; ; ; rationalizing the piping layout, according to risk categories, inside of dedicated trench ducts;
- ; ; ; Division of the subway in segments with fire resistant
segmentation plates such to separate the pipes according to the
substance categories transported;
- ; ; ; Passive fire protection of the steel structures supporting the pipe bundles inside the subway;
- ; ; ; Illumination, accessibility and inspectability of the subway
- ; ; ; Installation of:
 ;adequate retaining curbs inside the trench such to limit the extension of fire inside the trench,
 ;paving and drainage systems connected with the establishment sewage system;
- ; ; ; Increasing the number of extinguishing monitors, assuring the protection and coverage of the entire trench
- ; ; ; Installation of further Emercency Isolation Valves (EIV) on all
critical pipe lines, the signals of the valves are transmitted to the
control room and to the safety room of the area;
- ; ; ; Installation of Thermal Reaction Valves (TRV) on all isolatable pipe line sections.
The company evaluates to extend the above mentioned technical
improvements to the other subways of the refinery, depending under
other factors from the results of the evaluation by the Technical
Regional Committee (CTR).

Corrective actions in the management:
- On 21/06/06 a meeting of the Safety and Health Committee was
organized, with the goal to analyse the event and point out the lessons
learnt and the measures to be taken.
- ; ; ; Increase the frequency of training courses for the personnel by internal training personnel
- ; ; ; Foresee specific updating courses for the training personnel, and
specific training courses for the department foremen and the management
of the company
- ; ; ; Improve the circulation of the contents of the safety report such to improve the safety consciousness of the personnel
- ; ; ; Identification by the department foremen of sensitive aspects
needing improvement in the Safety Management System (SMS), e.g.
incompleteness or excessive complexity. of the procedures foreseen by
the SMS.
- ; ; ;  ;Identification of behavioural dynamics in the personnel
indicating reduced attention to safety and setting up a safety prize
- ; ; ; Increase the frequency of training courses for the personnel in
particular concerning the respect of emergency response procedures,
following the cascade principle.
At the date of the present report the company declared to have realised
the majority of the management measures described above: Moreover it is
planned to update the technical and operative documentation related to
the technical modification measures mentioned.

The event was triggered by the failure of tank T-3002 in correspondence of the lower  shell part of the same tank.Meteorological conditions - Remarks: the wind caused difficulties inside the retention basinto keep the surface of the spilled oil covered with foam Wind speed: 2.00, ; Wind direction: Est-Nord-Est, Temperature: 18.00
Discussion about Occurrence:At 18:00 hrs on 1/05/2006 alarm was triggered due to smell perception and to the tank level alarm triggered at a variation of &gt;5 cm in the transfer control room; the alarm was caused by a release of crude oil in the storage area south east of the establishment, controls established a relevant leakage of crude oil in the inferior part of the floating roof tank T-3002.The onsite emergency plan specific for the storage area of the installation was triggered. The other production units of the installation did not shut down, ; because general emergency was not declared, .The tank was insulated from the other systems of the installation by shutting down all electrical systems.The onsite fire brigade intervened, composed by two fire fighters and 1 company's employees (standard composition of the team during week ends) and was promptly integrated by other 8 trained workers.The plant operators provided to transfer of ; remaining product in the tank T-3002 into tanks T-3001 and T-3004 with fixed pumps. At the same time the onsite fire brigade started to spray foaming agentst inside of the containment basin with ; the onsite fire extinguishing equipment, such to cover constantly the surface of the still leaking product.At 18:00 hrs the company official in charge as onsite emergency manager ; informed the provincial command of the fire brigade in Taranto which intervened with own equipment.The transfer of the spilled ; oil, which was continuosly leaking from the tank, ; was pèerformed with of four mobile pumps, and was kept under constant control by the onsite fire brigade and the public fire brigade of Taranto. The public fire brigade of Taranto kept on spraying discontinuously the surface of the released product with foaming agents in order to maintain it constantly covered.Several teams of the public fire brigade intervened until 19:00 hrs of 05/05/2006 when the product released was completely pumped off from the containment basin.The large amount of spilled product caused difficulties in the product transfer process, due to the fact that the release rate of the spilling product was much higher than the capacity the fixed pumps, therefore the level of spilled products was increasing constantly. ;Maintaining a constant foam level on the spilled product, in order to avoid formation of explosive/flammabnle air/product mixtures, was very difficult due to the fact, ; that the basin surface was very large and that the leaking liquid was causing a strong turbulence associated with the wind. It was feared that the leaking product could overflow the dams o the containment basin (having an equivalent volume to the damaged tank) due to the amounts of foam sprayed on the crude oil surface.Two road tankers and 8 trailers of high and medium expanding foam were used.The provincial fire brigade intervened with 4 vehicles and 26 men. Vapour concentrations of the spilled oil were continuously monitored on top of the containment basin dam, during the transfer operation of the spilled crude oil ; The concentration levels determined during the monitoring variated ; from 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.The railway lines Taranto - Bari, Taranto- Metaponto were closed down as a precautionary measure until 5:30 hrs. on 2/05/2006.The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.The area affected by the spillage was put under continuous surveillance by the onsite fire fighting team and by the public fire brigade of Taranto. Several teams of the public fire brigade have been intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operations of the containment basin terminated.The failure of tank T-3002 has caused the release of approx. 30.000 m3 of crude oil corresponding to approx. 26.000 t.At the date of this report the environmental impact on the soil of the containment basin has been analysed whereas soil ; remediation measures had were to be taken for the containment basin.

A crude 50% solution of hydroxylamine was charged into the circulating high-concentration hydroxylamine. Then the hydroxylamine solution was heated to evaporate some part of the hydroxylamine. Next, in the column, 50% hydroxylamine vapor went to the top of the column and a 80% hydroxylamine solution dropped to the bottom. As a ferrous ion contained in feedstock at about 50 ppb is reduced to 1 ppb or less in the product, part of the circulation liquid was drawn out from the bottom circulation line. Emergency blow-down piping was installed at the underside of the bottom circulation piping to draw out column fluid in an emergency, and a block valve was installed just apart from the branching point. Very short piping from the branch to the block valve was dead-end piping. The major cause is as follows: A very small amount of ferrous ions in the circulation liquid dropped to the dead-end piping, and accumulated gradually. The accumulated iron caused exothermic decomposition, and detonation was propagated from the re-distillation column bottom.

Description of the situation prior to the accident:1. ; ; ; 8.1.2006 - technology shutdown of HCN and cyanide production. At the time the AKH production was not in operation, DPG production was in normal operation as was the pumping of wastewater from the hydraulic barrier. 2. ; ; ; Only wastewater from the DPG and hydraulic barrier was lead to the WWTP - detoxication sump. In order to clean the equipment on 8.1.2006 the cyanide production equipment remained shutdown. Once the WWTP (chemical) container was filled, the wastewater was pumped to the WWTP - detoxication sump for further treatment. Monitoring of the detoxication sump is done both by a floating gauge that signals that the sump is full and by visual inspection by service staff. 3. ; ; ; The night shift 8/9.1.2006 - according to the staff working on the night shift no variation from the normal operation was noted after shutting down the HCN and cyanide production. During the night the temperature dropped from approx. 13°C to -15°C. Due to the fact that water leaking during shutdown of production is much more concentrated, pretreatment was performed on detoxication sump 3 which was unsuccessful. A responsible staff member was made aware of this by telephone at approx 11 o'clock pm. He decided to fill the sump and that treatment would be performed on the morning shift. In the second half of the shift no employees were working in the vicinity of the sumps neither were the sumps visually inspected. Employees left the plant at 6 o'clock am.2. Temporal course of the accident in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump at LZD and subsequent action taken:1. ; ; ; 9.1.2006 the detoxication sump WWTP was found to be completely full in the early hours; a responsible employee determined that there was no overflow from the sump. Responsible employee who filled the sump took these immediate measures:- ; ; ; In conformity with the working instruction PI 1201-16-02; point 5.1 (deviation from the normal technological regime) a submerged pump was used to pump the content of sump 3 (full sump) to sump 2 to reduce its volume.- ; ; ; The equipment was checked to determine why there was no signal that the sump was full. It was determined that the floating signal gauge was frozen (due to the low temperatures during the night). The indicator of the gauge was freed manually and the gauge immediately began to operate with no problem.- ; ; ; The concentration of the discharged water was checked and found not to exceed the limit values.After taking these measures he checked the other parts of the WWTP and chemical WWTP. On his return he realized that the pump hose was pulled out of the side of the sump. On first inspection no water was flowing from the hose and nothing indicated that any water had escaped from the sump. Therefore he did not evaluate the situation at this time as an accident and did not report anything to his superiors. This information only came to light in his statement dated 10.2.2006. ; ; ; ; ; 2. ; ; ; 12.1.2006 (in the early hours) - service staff at the Podebrady and Nymburk dams informed the water management control center of the Labe river catchment authorities of considerable fish fatalities near the hydraulic power station. The police, CIZP, and the local fishery unions in Podebrady and Nymburk were informed immediately. Analysis of the dead fish determined an accidental degradation of water quality caused by an unknown material, which was subsequently determined to be total cyanide.3. ; ; ; 13.1.2006 (Friday) - CIZP performed an inspection at LZD in order to determine the possibility of a release of cyanide. After a local investigation they determined that the presence of cyanide in the Labe could have originated at LZD. The CIZP hypothesis stated that most probably an overflow of the detoxication sump occurred and water was released through the company's sewerage system to the Labe. ; 4. ; ; ; 16.1.2006 (Monday) - an internal committee was set up to determine:· ; ; ; Whether or not the ecological accident was caused by contaminated water from LZD· ; ; ; The actual cause of the accident· ; ; ; The temporal course of the accident· ; ; ; Effective remedial measures4. ; ; ; 16.1.2006 - technical equipment was inspected at the WWTP - detoxication sump to determine the possible cause of the accident. From the first information given by staff on the morning shift it was determined that during the change of shifts on 9.1. detoxication sump 3 was found to be completely full whereby they pumped part of the contents and that they subsequently found the signal gauge to be frozen and fixed this problem. There was no mention at this stage that the pump hose was found beside the sump. Based on this information the floating signal gauge was checked and was taken into consideration during the investigation of the occurrence and causes of the accident, and relevant remedial measures were taken i.e. increase in frequency of physical inspection in the area of discharge of wastewater from LZD. ; 5. 16.1.2006 - CIZP performed another inspection where further details of the accident came to light including the measures taken to avoid a repeat of the accident. 6. ; ; ; 16.1.2006 - considering the local investigation performed together with CIZP and the information given by staff of the morning shift the Commission stated that on the 9.1.2006 there was most probably an accident at LZD involving a release of an undefined volume of discharge water to the Labe. 7. ; ; ; 16.1-17.12006 - based on point 6 remediation of the surroundings of the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed including measures to limit release to the sewerage system. 8. ; ; ; 17.1.2006 - LZD presented its statement at a press conference that based on internal investigation and the conclusion of CIZP an accident occurred on 9.1.2006 which led to the release of wastewater with an undefined content of cyanide to the Labe.9. ; ; ; 17.1.2006 - LZD announced a major accident pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 2 of Act 353/1999 Coll. to the relevant state administration within the legal deadline (i.e. within 24 hours of determining an accident occurred).10. ; ; ; 19.1.2006 - first negotiations between LZD and the local fishery unions on compensation for damages caused by the accident.11. ; ; ; 20.1.2006 - a report was submitted to CIZP on remedial measures to be taken and their deadlines for elaboration. 12. ; ; ; 23.1.2006 - internal guidelines (organization regulations) were issued at LZD to improve controls and record keeping of the discharge of wastewater and to establish further measures to be taken to solve issues of wastewater discharge at LZD.13. ; ; ;  ;24.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. was commissioned to elaborate an expert opinion on the situation and the possible causes of the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.14. ; ; ; 26.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. submits his expert opinion to LZD.15. ; ; ; 27.1.2006 - CIZP issued a report on the fulfillment of remedial measures set by CIZP.16. ; ; ;  ;27.1.2006 - CIZP issued with the expert opinion on the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.17. ; ; ; 27.1.2006 - meeting between LZD and the Labe River Catchment Authority at which the accident was reviewed and proposals for further steps to be taken and cooperation between the two bodies were made.18. ; ; ; 31.1.2006 - LZD and the fisheries sign an agreement of financial compensation for losses caused by the accident.19. ; ; ; 27.1.2006 - 16.2.2006 - based on the conclusions of Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. and the information on total cyanide contamination in the river (taken from Labe River Catchment Authority reports) it was determined that the malfunction of the gauge could not be the only cause of the accident. For this reason and based on further investigation, the internal Committee came to the conclusion that human error was to some extent involved in the accident.20. ; ; ; 10.2.2006 - internal investigation with staff members of energy production and in particular those who were preset on the night and morning shifts prior to and during the accident. This resulted in the opinions of individual employees on the course of the shifts prior to and during the accident. In particular Mr. Charamzy (WWTP - sump service staff member), Mr. Krutsky (WWTP - sump supervisor) and Mr. Soukup (head of energy production). 21. ; ; ; 17.2.2006 - on the basis of the results of the internal investigation the general manager was informed of the possible causes of the accident by an internal memo which stated that several human errors occurred during the accident, including:- ; ; ; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not correctly evaluate the state of the detoxication sumps during the night shift or organize the activity of the service staff,- ; ; ; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor acted carelessly during pumping of the detoxication sump,- ; ; ; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor poorly evaluated the situation ; from the point of view of the possible release of toxic water and accident occurrence and did not inform his subordinates,- ; ; ; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not divulge all of the facts important in determining the causes of the accident during the first internal investigation.22. ; ; ; 21.2.2006 - LZD informed the public at a press conference that based on the internal investigation it was determined that other than the technical malfunction, human error was also to blame for the accident.3. Remedial measures taken after discovery of accident:The following measures were taken at LZD after the accident of 9.1.2006 (adopted in cooperation with CIZP):Immediate measures taken after determining the accident:- ; ; ; The rainwater sewerage system was shut down in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump and the sewerage system was temporarily insulated with a VAPO pneumatic filling. When the climatic conditions improve the outlet will be concreted. Concreting was performed in the second half of 2006.- ; ; ; Signalization system was improved with doubling the amount of floating signalization gauges- ; ; ; Physical checks of the working of the floating signalization gauges at the beginning of each shift change were initiated.- ; ; ; Expert opinion on the analysis of the state of the signalization gauge in sump 3 was commissioned with emphasis on the possible technical malfunction on 9.1.2006.- ; ; ; Frequency of visual checks on filling of detoxication sumps increased to once per hour at least for each sump.- ; ; ; Above-ground supply pipes were checked for integrity of joints.- ; ; ; Pump hoses were changed and an overall inspection of pumps used in the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed.- ; ; ; Frequency of analyses of discharged wastewater from LZD outlets increased, specifically for presence of cyanide min. once every 2 hours on specific objects. - ; ; ; The system for control and recording of wastewater discharge from the detoxication sumps was changed. New internal guideline OP VR 13 - 06 - ""control of discharged wastewater from the detoxication sump WWTP"" was elaborated, which sets the scope and method of record keeping of wastewater discharge, in particular it sets the responsibility for responsible people to give signed permission for the discharge of the sumps.- ; ; ; Training and testing of all service staff of the detoxication sumps on their knowledge of internal technological guidelines related to their employment was performed.The following measures were not taken immediately or could not be taken immediately:- ; ; ; Rapid construction of new chemical-biological WWTP with deadline to be in pilot operation 31.10.2006 at the latest.- ; ; ; Evaluation of the current capacity of the WWTP - detoxication sumps- ; ; ; Issuing of internal memo to inform all employees of set limits for wastewater discharge from LZD for CN- tox and CN- total.- ; ; ; Directive of the general manager issued at the managerial meeting 23.1.2006, ""During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation"".In order to fulfill the long-term and short-term measures the following tasks were accepted in the minutes from operational meeting no. 4 dated 23.1.2006:-  ; ; ; verify production technology in areas where a release of hazardous compounds to the environment may occur and up-date or change documentation in order to reduce the volume o hazardous compounds and the risk of release  ; ; ; Deadline for fulfillment of task: 30.6.2006 ; ; ; Completion: task is completed, responsible person ing.

Evaluation of the actions of LZD employees during the accident, verification of operative processes of employees and their compliance with the law and LZD internal guidelines:Description of the WWTP - detoxication sumpWastewater from the production of AKH and DPG are lead to the detoxication sump from the hydraulic barrier and wastewater with a high content of CN ions for rinsing of cyanide production equipment. Under normal operational conditions the following average daily volumes are lead to the WWTP - detoxication sumps:from DPG production  ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ; 100 - 120 m3from AKH production and HCN ; ; ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ; ; 30 - 35 ; m3from Hydraulic barrier ; ; ;  ;  ; ; ;  ; ; ; 10 - 15 ; m3Wastewater from the production of HCN and NaCN are lead to the chemical WWTP, which treats water with high content of CN ions. Toxic water in the WWTP-detoxication sump usually has toxic levels ranging in the hundreds of mg CN-/l.The total capacity of the detoxication sumps under normal operational conditions is 250 m3 (40% of which is suspension). This volume guarantees sufficient wastewater containment for detoxication. In exceptional cases (malfunction of the striper, malfunction in the production of cyanide, shut down of HCN or cyanide production) the WWTP-detoxication sump is used for disposal of wastewater from the cyanide production or HCN. This wastewater is more toxic with values can range in the thousands of mg CN-/l. The volume of wastewater that can be lead to the detoxication-WWTP is given by the method of treatment and retention of the individual apparatus for the production of HCN and cyanide, and ranges in (max.) tens of m3.Description of the activities of service staff at the WWTP - detoxication sumpThe internal guidelines PI 1201-16-02 ""Detoxication sump"" and TR 1201-04-02 ; ""Detoxication sump"" were issued for operation of the technology. Employees are made familiarly with theses internal guidelines which are constantly made available and are obliged to follow them. Wastewater discharge is recorded on the form ""summery of pumped sumps, volumes of wastewater and consumption of raw materials"". The detoxication process and results of analytical evaluation are written on the operational sheet ""Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)"". Apart from during the main shift, analytical evaluation is performed at the weekends and during unmanned shifts by the water management laboratories at LZD. During the main shift analytical evaluation is performed during inter-operational controls. The results are recorded in the relevant laboratory logs and on the operation sheet ""Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)"". Technological regulation in Chapter 7.1. Deviations from the normal technological regime includes the procedure during treatment and discharge of wastewater for possible very alkaline water, large volumes of cyanide ions and in the case that the wastewater can no be treated using the standard methods. In this case it is permitted to pump the wastewater over a longer period of time in order to reach the required limit concentrations. The values of contamination in the discharged wastewater from the LZD site in indicator CN ions (toxic and total) are set by a valid permit issued by the relevant water management authority, which is the environmental and agriculture department of the regional office of the central Bohemian region. The permit was issued 17.8.2004 and is valid to 31.12.2006.Values for wastewater discharged from the LZD site are as follows:- CNtox ; ; ; ; 3 mg/l- CNtotal ; 10 mg/l ; ; ; All activities were performed by the service staff during the accident of the 9.1.2006 according to the above-mentioned technological documentation. The only error of the service staff was to not secure the pumping hose and to not pay adequate attention during pumping. On the other hand though, the WWTP - detoxication sump is not an area that is permanently manned i.e. staff members perform other duties in conformity with their work responsibilities, the WWTP - detoxication sump therefore is not constantly manned.Another error of service staff was to not inform superiors or investigators of the accident of the hose that was pulled out and lying on the edge of the sump.5. Conclusion:On the basis of the internal investigation of committee the following conclusions have been made:The accident of 9.1.2006 occurred due to several factors. The low temperatures had a negative effect on the formation of nontoxic forms of cyanide and on the floating signalization gauge. ; This however was not the main cause of the accident. The Commission states that the service staff of the WWTP - detoxication sump in essence acted in conformity with valid internal guidelines, even though the accident occurred, whose cause was the carelessness of service staff, and in particular:1. ; ; ; insufficient securing or no securing at all of pump hose during pumping wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2. 2. ; ; ; carelessness during pumping of wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2, and not discovering that the pump hose on the edge of the sump was extracted, which was most probably the cause of the release of toxic wastewater to the company's sewerage system and subsequently to the Labe.3. ; ; ; not informing subordinates of the extracted pump hose on the edge of the sump, and subsequently not informing management during the investigation of the accident.Criminal responsibility of service staff flowing from the above mentioned errors is in the full competence of the authorities acting in legal procedures.After evaluating the adopted measures, both immediate and subsequent, the Commission states that the scope of these measures was and is adequate for the occurrence of an emergency situation and that all measures are duly fulfilled.Done in Kolin 31.3.2006Signatures of Committee Members: ; ; ; ; Ing.

664,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"During chlor-alkali electrolysis an accident occurred in which chlorine was released due to a chlorine-hydrogen explosion: 

The electrolysis of chloro-alkali was performed, as it had been for the previous days, near to the technical capacity. The plant produced 15.6 tonnes chlorine/h and was in normal conditions. There were no evident deviations from the safe operating mode. At the time of the disturbance (accident, failure, breakdown) the shift was manned with a regular crew of 9 persons. The person charged with the control of the measurements was informed by an acoustic signal that a short circuit had occurred in one of the cells. This occurrence is not exceptional and is generally caused by a slight pressure fluctuation in the hydrogen system, which is passed back through the sloping connection between the hydrogen and the chlorine sections. Searching the cause of the increased hydrogen pressure, the controller found immediately out that the hydrogen compressor, which removes all hydrogen from the plant, broke down. He then tried to restart the compressor, which succeeded in the first instance. But short time afterwards, the aggregate broke down again. It is assumed that the low-pressure blocking system caused the break down of the aggregate. The crew observed at that time that a considerable release of hydrogen occurred from the small pipes of the amalgam decomposers. The reason of it is a not sufficient discharge of hydrogen over roof passing through a hydraulic guard foreseen for such cases. This hydraulic guard was set on 70 mm water level and transports the hydrogen without danger over the roof. The container is laid out in accordance with such cases. On the day of the operational disturbance, however, the function of the safety devices was limited (which was not recognized), because a non-irrelevant dirt deposition had formed inside, which increased the counter pressure. Hydrogen reached the cell-space through the mercury pump, which transfers the regenerated mercury again in the electrolytic cell. This fast and massive intrusion of hydrogen caused at least locally the formation of an explosive mixture. The first heavy explosion destroyed a part of the cells as well as the chlorine collection pipe of the new cell-block passing under the explosion point. The plant was shut down by emergency shut down by the crew immediately after the explosion.

Immediately after the bromine release, a watchman activated the emergency stop. The shut-off valve closed within approx. 3 s.

Almost no bromine was released during this process. Subsequently, the remaining content of the inner pipe of the double wall pipe was transferred into the rail tanker. This reduced the hazards. According to a worst case scenario, at his time there were still ca. 30 l of bromine in the double wall jacket.The bromine inside the wagon was strongly heated by the sun shining on the black PE (polyethylene) double wall pipe. There was the risk of a rupture of the PE box near the shut-off valve. An attempt to reduce the pressure on the emptying valve before a receiving arm by shortly opening was aborted, because of the high temperature of the bromine a strong spontaneous evaporation occurred.

After the part of the installation affected had been identified and isolated, it was decided to let the naphtha burn out under control, while nitrogen was used to push out the residual naphtha from the equipment.The cause of the event was probably linked to maintenance works on a cracking furnace.In order to clean out the coke deposited inside the cracking tubes as a consequence of the reaction mechanisms, the smaller cracking furnaces have to be shut-down every 60 days. The coke is then burnt into CO2 through controlled feeding of water vapour and air into the cracking tubes.Before this operation, the cracking tubes must be thoroughly flushed to remove any hydrocarbon residues, after which the cracking tubes must be safely separated from the naphtha system. To do this, besides shutting off the valves, blanking plates are placed in the inlets of the furnace.In the case being considered, this switch-over of furnaces was being carried out.

A clearly detectable foam layer had formed and had released the overflow protection alarm.About 30 l of phosphoric acid added immediately for stabilisation, had no apparent effect. Next, a valve was closed between the first tank and an adjacent tank connected to it, and the first tank's contents was drained into a secondary containment basin. At the same time, the drained hydrogen peroxide was diluted with water, and the vapours were abated. In addition, the tank was externally cooled with water.Because of the risks for the emergency response team, the drainage had to be stopped.

This ventilation pipe leads to a decanter, used for a safe drainage of hydrogen peroxide in case of release.

707,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"SAFETY SYSTEMS OR OPERATORS INTERVENTION:Sprinkler system was automatically activated at 55 to 60°C.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:On July 14, maintenance works were completed and, after the inspection by the plant operator, the start-up of the facility was initiated at 21:30. Steam was admitted to the toaster and to the jackets of hexane/miscella inlet pipes to heat-up the toasters and the extractor to the proper operating temperatures. At about 21:45 the toasters reached their operating temperature and admittance of flakes commenced through the inlet screw conveyor. After that, the following events occurred (the time shown had been approximately evaluated on instrument readings and information from the staff, as no log was in operation) until the explosion took place at 00:47:- 22:45 to 23:00: The night shift took over and at the same time the first flakes dropped from the outlet screw conveyor into the toasters.- 23:15: The toaster temperature dropped to 85°C. The plant operator therefore opened fully for the steam flow to the toaster jackets and the upper parts (direct steam) of the toasters. About the same time the safety flap valve was heard lifting releasing hexane and steam into the extractor building, where the smell of hexane was detected by the operators. This was, however, not an abnormal occurrence during the start-up.- 23:25: One of the flake outlet conveyors stopped due to overloading and the interlocking system stopped the flake inlet conveyor and the internal belt conveyor but not the other outlet conveyor nor the steam and hexane flows. High hexane concentrations were detected in the extractor building. The plant operator, however, was of the opinion that the steam and hexane flows were stopped according to the operation procedure.- 23:35: The flake outlet conveyor was restarted and the operating staff began to search for the hexane release point but without success. The hexane concentration in the extraction building finally reached a level which forced the staff out of the extractor building.- 23:55: A bus driver passing the facility detected the hexane vapours and about the same time the sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the released hot hexane/steam mixture.- 00:15: The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (CPO). At the same time they stopped the above mentioned bus driver, when he was to pass again warning him against the possible danger. The bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade.- 00:25: The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance.- 00:35: The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty arrived. The CPO went into the extractor building and located the leak to the safety flap, from which gas/liquids clearly appeared.- 00:40-00:45: The CPO and the Fire Inspector discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to do this by cutting off the power supply. They called the power plant engineer and asked him to do it. Due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer at about 00:47.- 00:47.30: A fire seen in the far end of the extractor yard was spotted followed by a strong explosion injuring 27 persons (staff members, firemen and police officers) and damaging completely 6 buildings.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),,,,,"09 ii.

Based on the investigations carried out, it has been concluded that excessive amounts of steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor led to lifting and relocating of the safety flap valve. The steam leaking from the toaster to the extractor occurred due to lack of flakes in the outlet screw conveyors, which acted as a barrier against steam/gas flow. As a consequence, hexane was released and led to an explosion. Based on the available information it seems clear that the explosion was initiated by the disconnection of a transformer which ignited the hexane cloud.CAUSESThe leakage of hexane (flammable/explosive gas) was due to the incorrect operation of the safety flap valve caused by the failure of the interlocking system to cut-off the steam and hexane flows to the toaster when one of the extractor outlet conveyors was stopped. An unloaded transformer, disconnected by mistake just before the explosion, is believed to have caused the ignition of the hexane vapours cloud.",,,,,,,"After this accident, it has been decided that this plant will not be rebuilt.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:Following a visit of an expert group set up in France to establish new Safety Guidelines for extraction facilities in 1985, the following conclusions and recommendations have been considered for preventing similar accidents:1- release of gas from the safety flap must occur in a safe location;2- improvements for the design of the extractor building and its ventilation system would be necessary;3- improvements of the safety and interlock systems;4- improvements of gas detection and fire protection systems;5- improvement of the safety management.Useful references: More detailed information about the accident are contained in the document ""Ekplosionsulykken pa Dansk Sojakagefabrik"" of July 15, 1980."

Similar equipment was already in use for the same production but the new reactor was microprocessor controlled, especially for controlling the chlorine addition rate and the cooling in order to maintain the process conditions (30°C and atmospheric pressure) because the chlorination of 0,0-Dimethyl-phosphorodithiotic acid (MP-1) to MP-2 is exothermic.The reaction took place in extraction naphtha (E-60).

The production started at noon and the operators did not paid attention to the temperature that was recorded. Owing to a high chlorine addition rate and no cooling, the temperature rose to be in excess of 120°C about 2 hours after the production started.

The worker reached the area with a portable extinguisher and gas mask and found two rows of 1 tonne bags containing anhydrous sodium dichlorisocyanurate on the extreme left of the area and placed at a distance of 50 cm from each other. He could distinguish two piles of big bags in the front and another two big bags on the ground a bit more to the right. He declared that he could see smoke rising from the wooden pallet placed under the bag pile and the bottom bag on the right. He emptied the portable extinguisher, found another two and emptied them too but could not stop the combustion process and smoke development.The product leaking from the big bag at the bottom of the pile caused the two bags above to crash on the ground, feeding the combustion process, developing flames and intensive smoke.Meanwhile two other workers who had been alerted by the main alarm siren of the chlorine detectors reached the area shortly after the first worker and the shift supervisor sent them to the chlorine storage area. ; They connected an extinguishing hose to the manifold of two pumps feeding from two 10m3 water tanks, which were used for operations under normal conditions. The tanks are located approximately 20 metres from the area affected by the fire. Shortly after the extinguishing hose had been connected and a small amount of water had been ; pumped, the two pumps failed because the flames had reached the electric cable rack suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground and passing parallel to the front side of the transit area (located above the passage of the drainage channel). When the shift supervisor realised that the emergency response operation was impossible he alerted the security personnel of the plant and attempted to alert the fire brigade and the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (Centro de Emergencias de Catalunya - CECAT) but the telephone line was interrupted due to the fact that the telephone line also passes above the area in which the fire broke out.One of the workers, looking for a telephone, tried to kick open the entrance door of the administration offices but broke the glass with his foot and cut his leg (the injury was considered as not serious).At 20:43 hrs the emergency call number 112 received a phone call from a private citizen informing them that a fire had broken out in an industrial installation and the information was transmitted to the fire brigade.When local police officers of the Catalonian autonomous police force (Mossos d'Esquadra) arrived ; at the plant entrance and saw flames and smoke rising, they alerted the fire brigade.At 20:51 hrs a fire brigade helicopter making a routine flight over the area reported that the size of the smoke cloud was large and that chlorine could be smelled.The safety manager of the company arrived and at 20:58 hrs alerted the Emergency Response Centre of Catalunya (CECAT), responsible for releasing the Off-site Emergency Plan, informing them that the fire was significant and that it was releasing chlorine into the atmosphere.At 20:50 hrs the fire brigade arrived on-site, the fire brigade was informed by the representatives of the operator about the fire, the release of chlorine and the need to employ self-contained breathing apparatus. The fire was spreading rapidly, affecting the installations passing through the roofing and the roofing panels of the transit area.

The issue of a series of general guidelines for installations producing or handling the same product or similar substances will be studied.The following conclusions were drawn from the accident:· ; ;  ;The use of the transit area as a storage area appears to be negligent with regards to safety and was worsened by the following factors:- ; ;  ;Significant amounts (54 tons/day before the accident) of product stored in a small area practically exposed to atmospheric conditions.- ; ;  ;The product safety sheet indicates that exposing the product to humidity and temperatures above 40°C should be avoided- ; ;  ;Irregular storage duration: three months.- ; ;  ;Lack of specific fire fighting equipment for the area.- ; ;  ;Design of the area, the cable racks were suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground but the piles of product reached a height of 3.5 meters.· ; ;  ;Operative procedures and safety management system. Unsafe practices:- ; ;  ;Failure to recover the spilled product with the intention to postpone the operation to the next day.- ; ;  ;Leaving a fork lift truck near the big bags with the risk associated to the presence of fuel.- ; ;  ;There were no written procedures on the measures to be taken in case of the rupture of a bag and product spill, although it appears that the workers knew that they had to be careful during product recovery and that contaminated products had to be sent for disposal.· ; ;  ;According to the workers bag ruptures were frequent. Moreover they all report ; having seen sodium dichlorisocyanurate react with trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) with fuel or water in the processing area. Consequently although risks were known the safety measures taken were not sufficiently effective.· ; ;  ;The installation did not comply with the regulations set out by the current legislation according to the results of the inspections foreseen for Major Accident Hazard installations, although the non-compliance did not concern classified substances. Although the operator was still within the terms for the corrective measures set out following the inspection, but not all of them, it has to be said that this does not exempt the operator from the exclusive responsibility with regards to the non-compliance with the applicable regulations as from the date these regulations were implemented in Spanish law.Measures to mitigate consequences: The lack of an extinguishing water system independent of the process, although not obligatory, associated with the failure of the electric cable system led to the plant not being able to respond to the emergency ; with its own means, having ; to depend completely on external emergency response services and fire brigades.Alternative systems are being studied.Useful references:The medical services reported that no patients were treated for the effects of the toxic cloud but complaints concerning irritation to eyes and respiratory tract were received by local police officers of adjacent municipalities and by the emergency number 112. This leads us to suppose that the smoke cloud was at such a height not to affect the population of the rural area nearest to the plant, in which there are farm buildings. When the smoke cooled down and reached the ground it was sufficiently diluted not to cause any severe health consequences to people.The fact that the population living in the vicinity was alerted and requested to take shelter in their homes and to close doors and windows certainly contributed to reducing the consequences of this event."

Due to insufficient temperature and pressure in this unit, extraction did not occur. The gases accumulated in the petrol tank (2178 C) forming a pocket that spread outside the recipient until an ignition source set off a gas blast. The explosion occured at 8:15 am and displaced the tank's floating roof (2178 C) and began the combustion of the gasoline contained within it (2 400 m3). The fire spread to the other gasoline tanks housed in the same area (C 2) as well as to the outer lying installations.

Brief description of the event:
Separating operation is performed without inertization. There is no indication on whether Nitrogen was connected or not. There was no kind of safety measure in case of absence of nitrogen, since this was not considered in operation procedures. The result was the explosion of the centrifugal pump and death of an operator.It can be indicated, as causes for the explosion the lack of efficient inertization of the centrifugal pump, lack of risk analysis and lack of operating procedures, along with an efficient system for risk control and inspection. According to the data available, the inspector reporting states that, had the establishment had documentation conforming and implementing RD 1254/1999, it would have been very unlikely that the accident would have taken place, so it cannot be excluded as a cause for the accident the failure of the establishment to comply with the law.Apart from material causes for the accident, other organisational causes must be studied.

The drying phase was very long, and an aerosol outlet nozzle was blocked, causing local overheating.

The preventive measures are therefore: reduction of temperature at start-up, detection of accumulation of substance by installing sensors, not stocking the product in iron vessels, and avoiding the re-injection into the process of recycled water, which can have a high sulphur content.The protection measures rely on the materials used in the installation being non-inflammable. It is therefore proposed: ;- that the first stage of the water washer and the ventilation ducts be built of non-inflammable material ;- that rapid-closing valves be installed between the fluidised bed vaporiser and the water washer (this is also to be applied to other vaporisers connected to the washer) ;- to review the location of the final product storage silos in relation to the water washer."

814,Major Accident,"Production and storage of pesticides, biocides, fungicides","Hydrogen peroxide was used in a pharmaceutical industry to deodorize an aqueous chemical effluent containing various strong smelling sulphur compounds. The stainless steel treatment vessel was connected to a cast iron holding receiver by both top and bottom connections. The liquid was transferred by the bottom connection and any foam generated during the treatment vented back to the receiver using the top connection. When the treatment method was first adopted, foam had escaped out of the open man lid in the treatment vessel. The man lid was therefore sealed. The foam then passed up the vent system and contaminated the scrubber system. Hence the modification to vent the foam into the receiver. The treatment method for the effluent was provided by the firm's parent company which was specialized in hydrogen peroxide chemistry. The method used was first to add hydrogen peroxide (35%) and then caustic soda solution (25%) to bring the pH up to approximately 9. On some occasions foaming occurred. Management did not fully investigate these incidents; some of the operators were aware of a pressure rise in the treatment vessel if the caustic solution was added too quickly. On a cold Saturday morning in March an explosion occurred within the plant. The lid of the stainless steel vessel was blown off whilst the cast iron receiver was blown to pieces. A process operator nearby at the time was killed. A fire, producing an acidic smoke, then very rapidly spread through the entire building.Research followed the accident showed that the foaming was caused by the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, catalyzed by the sulphur compounds in the effluent. The decomposition reaction is also pH-dependent. At about pH=7.5, a rapid exothermic decomposition takes place. The heat produced is capable of vaporizing the various aliphatic alcohols also present in the effluent, producing a potential explosive mixture. This mixture would have filled the head space in the treatment vessel and then spilled into the empty receiver.

The production of a fertilizer with cigar-burning or self-sustaining decomposition 
properties, combined with an overheating of the material as it was being re-cycled through the dryer and with the stopping of the dryer for examination, gave rise to a rapid decomposition of the bulk of the material, resulting in the evolution of toxic fumes.
The combination of blended fertilizers containing single and triple super-phosphates with a mixture of NPK fertilisers gave rise to a combined fertiliser which had the property of self-sustaining decomposition. This is thought to be due to the unexpected presence of a high contents of insoluble phosphates. Whilst passing through the dryer, the temperature of the product rose to about 130oC causing a rapid exothermic reaction within the dryer with evolution of toxic fumes.The operator intervened by stopping the dryer when the temperature became so high that it created concern. Then a rapid exothermic reaction occurred within the dryer, resulting in the evolution of toxic fumes of nitrogen oxides (and, probably, of chlorine). There had been no previous accidents relating to bulk decomposition of fertilizers at this plant, although there had been decomposition of small amounts of fertilizers resting on hot surfaces throughout the life of the plant (30 years). The plant was in a large multi-floor building (approximately 50m x 50m and 30m high) containing two compound fertilizers production plants. Each plant included conveyor and elevator feed systems with raw material hoppers and weighing systems. These systems were connected to a blunger or mixer and into a 30m x 5m diameter rotary drier, thence by off-take conveyors and elevators to a finishing plant.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","CAUSES:1- The propylene oxide storage installation was entirely manually controlled so that incorrect setting (or passing) of a valve could result in mis-direction or mis-transfer of bulk material between the tanks. Though tanks overloading was a routine possibility as 18 tonnes road tankers deliveries have to be split between at least two tanks (capacity only 12 or 14 tonnes), no hardware safeguarded against overfilling was foreseen . This has been recently recognised by the Company during assessment for purposes of the CIMAH regulation: the consequent intention was to fit tank high level alarms.2) Staffing and supervision of the plant was inadequate. It had become customary to expect or allow plant operators to keep a check on process plant whilst overseeing tanker deliveries. Any delay on either job meant temporary neglect of the other. In view of the total lack of automatic safeguards continuous operator presence was essential and there should have been a clear rule that there was continuous attendance throughout all propylene oxide delivery and other transfers. This did not happen in practice and the Standard Operating Procedures though fairly detailed were not clear on this point though requiring the plant operator to 'observe the level rise in the receiving tank ... so as not to exceed 80% maximum ...'. Suspension of transfer if the operator has to leave the installation was not laid down.3) Line supervisors were insensitive to the obvious staff shortage on the day of the incident. The out-going supervisor should not have allowed unsupervised delivery to continue during shift change and the oncoming supervisor should likewise have suspended delivery operations or given/arranged adequate support for the lone shift operator.

821,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"The ambient temperature was near freezing and this allowed significant liquid to condense out in the flare pipelines. Wind conditions were slight and the vapours from the spilling liquid were not dispersed. In early 1986 it was noted that the flare gas recovery system was operating at reduced efficiency. Gas which should have been recovered was being routed instead to flare. Investigation revealed that a 750 mm valve was passing gas when in closed position. A decision was taken to have the valve removed to carry out repairs to it. It was appreciated that there would require to be careful planning to prevent the possibility of leave refinery units being inadvertently isolated from the flare system. One of the flares would have to be taken out of service and therefore the potential flaring demand of the refinery would need to be matched to the remaining two flares. At a number of meetings of operational and maintenance staff, an agreed flare alignment procedure was drawn up outlining flare system conditions necessary for removal of the valve. The earliest time to carry out the work was to be in early 1987 when 2 of the refinery units and flare No 1 were planned to be out of service for routine maintenance. The detailed work methods and safety requirements concerned with the actual removal of the valve were not considered at the meeting. No difficulties were foreseen and the works were organized and arranged by operations department technicians. Few days prior the accident, the valves to isolate live parts of the flare system from the section under maintenance were closed. Immediately prior to work commencing, the BP technician checked the status of isolation valves and he also identify conditions in the isolated section by opening a small valve on the liquid drain line at a distant flare knockout drum. Finding no indication of gas or liquid coming from the valve he assumed that the flare line was isolated, depressurised and free of liquid. Near the work station were located 2 water monitors to disperse residual gas if it should flow out when the valve was removed. Two refinery fire-fighters were present to operate the monitors and to oversee the use of the breathing apparatuses being used by the workers as protection against potentially toxic residual gases in the flare line. Also in the work area there was a crane to lift the heavy valve and a diesel engine compressor to supply air for the breathing apparatuses. Being everything in order, the BP technician issued the permit to the contractor and work commenced. Two fitters and a rigger prepared to remove a flange ring spacer to insert a blank spade in its taken by a crane.

This scale had flaked off from internal surfaces to accumulate at the bottom of the flare pipelines where it turned into a thick viscous-sludge in the presence of vented and condensed hydrocarbon liquids. The sludge had found its way into the guides of flare line wedge gate valves which where thus prevented from closing fully. Sludge had also passed down liquid drain lines at the knock-out drums to cause them to block. Therefore the normal drainage built into the flare system no longer operated and as a result substantial quantities of liquid accumulated. The flare line isolation valves had no means of indicating their fully closed position. It was assumed that exerting considerable force on the handles of valves was sufficient indication. Many of the suppose closed valves were found to be jammed and were still allowing free passages of gas. The pipe to the valve used to test line conditions was also blocked with sludge. Therefore presence of liquids and gases in the line was not identified when the valve was open. Furthermore, the technician judged that residual flammable gases in the flare pipe presented no significant fire hazard. Therefore the system was not purged with inert nitrogen nor steam. In addition, the flare drainage was not verified as being clear of blockages nor the valves as being clear obstruction by the use of injected steam.

822,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:The morning was fine and cold with only a slight breeze.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:A control valve on the liquid line between the HP and the LP Separators was opened in error and the liquid allowed to drain. High pressure hydrogen passed uncontrolled into the closed LP Separator which had limited pressure relief capacity. It overpressurised rupturing at an estimated pressure of 50 bar. The explosion disintegrated the separator and also damaged other vessels and pipes. Released flammable substances were ignited resulting in jet-fires.The hydrocracker unit was commissioned in the early 1970's. The potential for high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP separator was recognized in the design and the flow control valves in the line from the HP separator to the LP separator had provided to automatically close should liquid level in the HP Separator reach a critical pre-determined low point. The safety system was arranged to operate from either of a pair of low level magnetic float switches mounted on a bridle tube attached to the HP Separator. In a safety audit and in a review of pressure relief capacity within the hydrocracker complex which were carried out in 1975, the operator of the refinery concluded that high pressure gas breakthrough into the LP Separator would not arise because there was a safety trip actuated by low liquid levels.As a consequence the pressure relief valve on the LP Separator was sized only for fire engulfment on the vessel and was of comparatively small size. Throughout the 1970's the output of the hydrocracker was limited by a series of operational problems. By the early 1980's these were mostly overcome and throughput started to rise to exceed the design capacity of 23,000 barrels/day. At these high flow rates it was discovered that the liquid in the HP Separator became very turbulent. The rapidly changing liquid levels caused spurious trips of the control valve which in turn caused severe operational difficulties. The low liquid level control valve trip system also lost favour for various other reasons. For example frequent blockages of the pipework leading to the level detectors caused by build up of hard carbon residue and by the solidification of waxy liquids in cold weather. The system was unreliable and therefore was distrusted. Furthermore trips would be over-ridden prior to shut-down so that residual liquid in the HP separator could be emptied. At low throughputs or during standby operation trips would also be over-ridden so that the valves could be opened to allow liquid remaining in the line from the HP separator to be blown clear to prevent accumulation of solidifying wax. As a consequence, in the early 1980's the control valve trip was removed and not replaced. It was left to the operators to detect dangerous low levels and close the valves when they judged it appropriate. Removal of the safety system was authorized at operations supervisor level.

825,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:During the manufacture of lubricating oil, there was a build up of asphalt and other residual oils in the propane recirculating system.

The asphalt and residual oils were drained to the plant's surface drain and then to an interceptor pit; any propane present would evaporate. The accumulator vessel had a capacity of approximately 24 tonnes of propane at 50°C and 21 bar. During the shift preceding the accident, the drain line from the drain vessel was found to be plugged; after an unsuccessful attempt to remedy this, it was closed. Draining of the asphalt and other residual oils from the recirculating system into the drain vessel was started.

The shift controller manually closed the valve between the propane recirculating system and the drain vessel. The on-site emergency services were called but on their arrival the gas cloud was already safely dispersed.The propane release was attributed to the plugging of the drain valve by a solid plug of asphalt and/or ice, not allowing it fully closing after draining.

The two operators investigating the previously reported noises from the pump were engulfed in ammonia and immediately overcome by fumes.

The supply of ammonia from the ring main could only be stopped by switching off the supply pump locally.

Wind direction = 340° with a speed of ?? m/s.ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The accident occurred in a peak saving station used to store liquefied natural-gas (LNG). The station included a natural gas liquefaction unit, a LNG storage and a LNG compression/vaporization/water bath Thurley vaporizer-facilities. During peak demands, LNG was pumped up to 82 barg to 8 vaporisers from which the gas was injected into the transmission line to 72 barg. As a routine exercise to verify the availability of the site to export gas, the equipment had to be brought to a ""1- hour"" stand-by condition and LNG used to cool down pipes and pumps between the storage tanks and vaporisers. The Thurley vaporiser consisted of a large steel water tank, the water being heated by 6 gas burners. The air supply for the burners was coming from a single local fan via ductwork (up to 24"" diameter). The LNG passed through tubes inside the water bath, evaporating and warming up to 20°C. The LNG inlet to the vaporiser was controlled by a motorised hand indicated control (HIC) valve from the control room. An additional emergency shut-down (ESD) valve could be operated locally or remotely. Between these valves there were four drain valves and a relief valve. The drain valves were 0.5 m and 1.5 m above the ground level. The lower level drain valves were the ones normally used.On December 5, an availability exercise was carried out and five of the 8 vaporisers had to be brought to a ""1- hour"" stand-by condition. Two operators were working on A, B and C vaporisers and other two on E and F vaporisers. The shift engineer was present to start-up the LNG pumps and open the main valve. Vaporisers A, B and C were cooled down according to the normal procedure (admission of small amounts of LNG and low level drain valves opened to accelerate the cooling) and vaporisers E and F were being closed when the pumps were started resulting in a jet of LNG from one of the open drain valves. 30 seconds later there was an explosion and fire-ball.

829,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:The plant was initially commissioned in 1975 for the manufacture of chlorofluoaniline (CFA) but was also used for manufacturing fluoroaromatic compounds. The whole site contained plants covered by the requirements of Article 5; this specific plant did not however fall under the requirements of Artcile 5. The manufacturer had nevertheless prepared a safety report, which was submitted to the competent Authority at the correct time. This report categorized the process as relatively low risk (the reaction was only mildly exothermic and not very sensitive to small operational variations). The process included the production of difluoronitrobenzene (DFNB) by reacting dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB) with potassium fluoride at a temperature of 165°C and atmospheric pressure. DFNB was purified by centrifuge and distillation and was subsequently hydrogenated to difluoroaniline (DFA), an intermediate for the pharmaceutical industry. DCNB and DFNB were identified as substances which could decompose violently at temperatures above 220°C but no circumstances were foreseen which could result in the temperature of the mixture being raised by such a large amount above the normal operating temperature. A few weeks before the accident, the distillation mixture had been contaminated with water through two leaking valves. It was believed that the water had been removed by distillation. During the heating phase the operators realized that the temperature was rising fast, but could do little to control it. The reactor vented, flames were seen to ignite at the top of the reactor and then an explosion occurred, followed by a serious fire.

The failure of the two valves and the subsequent gross water contamination were the first critical initiating events. There was an attempt to remove the water using a second distillation on the water/toluene intercut. Failure to remove water may have been due to phase separation of water in the base of the main distillation column. The dimethylacetamide (DMAC) solvent was hydrolized to acetic acid. It was known that DMAC does not easily hydrolyse to acetic acid, but fluoroaromatic compounds acted as catalysts (this catalytic property was not previously known) causing an increased acetic acid production. Acetic acid was accumulate in the DMAC because of the similar boiling points. It is worth noting that the accident occurred when the batch loaded into the reactor was the first one to completely use recycled DMAC following its contamination with water. Laboratory investigations have shown that 2-10% w/w acetic acid in DMAC gives a reproducible rapid exothermic reaction at 140-160°C, producing a high yield of higher weight molecular substances with evolution of gas (CO2). This lower temperature exothermic reaction drove the temperature up to that which initiated the violent decomposition of the nitrobenzene compounds. Metallurgical examinations indicated that the vessel failed at about 20-25 bar and 500°C, conditions far above its design pressure and substantially higher than its test pressure. Cooling through both the external jacket and the open vent to a knock-out pot could not cope with the violent decomposition and prevent the pressure build-up in the reactor.","component/machinery failure/malfunction

The blockage was cleared but the operator was unable to close the gate valve due to caustic soda and LPG released at high temperature and pressure (the disconnection of the pipework was not done in accordance with the sites standing instructions). In order to reduce the pressure in the depropaniser to mininimise the amount of LPG escaping from the 50mm valve, a 406mm pneumatically operated depressurizing valve was opened. This valve, with a rated capacity of 13.375 tons per minute, was designed to depressurize the interconnected depropaniser and polypropylene splitter columns in 15 minutes via a 762mm line into the main 910mm flareheader.

842,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
The Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) was shut-down because of the failure of the air blowers that provided the oxygen to regenerate the catalyst in the regenerator. It was decided that the shut-down would be an opportunity to conduct some repairs and maintenance and also to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that had been recently installed within the regenerator. The catalyst was removed from the base of the generator by a nitrogen assisted steam reduction system until the entry into vessel was possible. The vessel was isolated in preparation (270 blinds had to be inserted before operational procedures allowed entry). The operational procedures that were followed were those that had been successfully used before. Although, it is now realized that they did not take into account the particular set of conditions (that is the large amount of un-regenerated catalyst) in this instance.At approximately 17:30 on Thursday 9, January, fitters started to remove 2 man-way covers on the generator. First a 30"" cover was removed to allow a preliminary visible inspection. No gas tests were made prior to opening as the system was considered to be open to atmosphere because of its flue to the stack. However, the removal of a valve and flow nozzle in the flue duct work may have reduced the draw of the flue on the regenerator and, therefore, contributed to an oxygen deficiency in the regenerator. The first cover was removed without mishap and the fitters proceeded to open a second 60"" man-way which was just being held by 2 bolts and a block and tackle. One bolt was removed when witnesses heard a rumbling noise from inside the regenerator. This was immediately followed by an orange-red flash came out on the left side of the man-way flange engulfing the group of workers on that side. After a few seconds, witnesses heard a seconf loud explosion. It occurred when the pressure wave from the first explosion reached the waste heat boiler (about 30 metres away) connected to the regenerator by a pipework.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),,,,"02.

00. NAMED SUBSTANCE","INITIATING EVENTS AND CONSEQUENCES:
During the shut-down of the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit, it was decided to make some repairs and maintenance and to monitor the condition of a new equipment configuration that was installed within the catalyst regenerator. To allow the access into the regenerator, two man-ways were removed and this provided an oxygen entry which produced an explosive mixture with the gases from the contaminated catalyst. The flammable mixture was then ignited and a confined explosion occurred.

CAUSES:
The initial failure of the blowers was caused by vibration to the blower turbine due to loose objects contacting the turbine blades. It has been assumed that these objects came from the actual engineering materials of the turbine itself.
The explosion was probably caused by a mixture of hydrogen, light hydrocarbon gases and carbon monoxide. This mixture was either above its auto-ignition temperature during the oxygen entry (when the man-way covers were removed) or was ignited by pyrophoric carbon deposits. The evolution of these gases was stimulated by the action of steam on the un-regenerated catalyst in an poor oxygen atmosphere (this reaction was discovered in subsequent laboratory experiments). This steam was injected immediately after the crash shut-down in an attempt to regenerate the catalyst and keep the catalyst bed fluid. The opening of the man-ways allowed sufficient oxygen enrichment for an explosive mixture in the previously stagnant internal regenerator atmosphere. This stagnation has thought to have occurred because of the new internal plant configuration which prevented the gases rising and escaping from the top flue and also because of the reduced flue draw caused by the removal of a valve and a nozzle in the ducts between the flue and the stack.",unexpected reaction/phase-transition,,"management attitude problem

843,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"ENVIRONMENTAL AND ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS:
Light wind from jetty to tank farm. Temperature slightly above freezing (around the freezing point of benzene). Ground wet due to recent rains.

ACCIDENT CASE HISTORY DESCRIPTION:
At 02:00 hours an operator detected a smell of benzene in the proximity of pump P-104. On investigating, he detected liquid escaping from a hose attached to a valve on the pump (this valve was found to be half open and was immediately closed). A sizeable quantity of liquid, thought to be a benzene/water mixture, was observed in the pipetrack. Management was alerted. No other people were working in the vicinity of the leak. It was found that the liquid was flowing along the pipetrack to the jetty and the jetty manager was informed by telephone. A considerable quantity of liquid was found to have collected in a sump on the jetty premises (this was part of the jetty pipeline containment system but not intended to collect liquid from the jetty tank farm). There was considerable soil contamination round this jetty tank farm pipeline (this pipeline did not have a proper containment system). On investigating, it was found that plant instrumentation detected and recorded a slow leak from the tank associated with this pipeline between 20:00 hours the previous evening and 02:00 hours. The leak was too slow to show up on the control panel display and was also masked by a ship loading benzene for part of the time. No people were affected by benzene fumes and no ignition occurred. It is estimated that benzene levels in the vicinity of the leak and along the pipetrack to the sump were likely to exceed the occupational exposure standard.  An ignition would have had major consequences.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to ground,fluid release to ground,,,,,,,,"02. TOXIC
07 b. HIGHLY FLAMMABLE - note 3(b)(2)","INITIATING EVENT AND CONSEQUENCES:
The leak of benzene involved the pump used to transfer benzene from the storage tank to the nearby jetty. Since the valve on a spare pressure gauge of the pump was not fully closed after a sampling operation, about 19,000 kg of benzene were lost over a period of six hours until the leak was detected.
CAUSES:
In order to allow the operators to take a quality control sample of the product immediately prior to ship loading, sampling points were provided on the tanks. For the benzene tank, due to security fencing, the access route to the sampling points was circuitous and the operators had got into the practice of taking a sample at the ""degassing"" point on the pump. This practice was apparently not known to management (probably including foreman). A hose was left attached to the connection point to facilitate this operation. The practice had been on-going for some months. In this occasion the operator failed to fully close the valve. The pump was bunded, but the length of hose extended beyond the bunding and the end was lying at the pipetrack. No equipment defects or failures were involved in the leak. Underlying cause was failure of management control and supervision, together with inadequate training and failure by operator to follow operating procedures.The accident occurred because of an operator error (code 5401) that failed to fully close the valve installed on the spare pressure gauge connection on a pump. The ""cap"" was removed to take a quality control sample of benzene but this procedure was apparently not known to management above foreman level. Underlying causes were therefore the management failure in control and supervision (codes 5301 and 5305), together with an inadequate operator training (codes 5304 and 5303).",,operator error,"management organization inadequate

As a result of previous incidents with valve packing followers, a visual verification of isolation valves in stainless steel systems was launched prior to the incident on 25/04/2015. The 2” drain valve that failed on 25/04 was in the scope of this verification and some comments were reported about the status of the valve:
No ice formation o Corrosion of bolts
Incident investigation results
Investigation of the failed valve shows clearly advanced corrosion of the nuts of the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve. The following construction materials were encountered:o The bonnet and body of the valve are constructed from austenitic stainless steel (316);
The valve is installed on a line constructed of low temperature carbon steel;
The 4 studs used to connect the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of ferritic stainless steel (410);
The 8 nuts on the studs connecting the bonnet and body of the valve are constructed of carbon steel;The following conclusions can be drawn upon investigation of the recovered valve:
The severe corrosion of the 8 carbon steel nuts on the 4 stainless steel studs/valve (see Figure 8) is consistent with a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion of the nuts.
The 4 stainless steel studs of the valve bonnet/body connection are in good condition.o Some of the nuts are missing because they were torn off during the ejection of the valve bonnet.o It is possible that the severely corroded nuts (including the missing nuts) were all located at the same side of the valve bonnet/body connection (back side).
According to the original specification, the 2” drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve instead of a stainless steel valve.o Besides carbon steel nuts on the studs of the valve bonnet/body connection, carbon steel nuts were also discovered on the studs of the valve flange/body connection (the 8 nuts on the blind flange are a mix of carbon steel nuts and stainless steel nuts. The carbon steel nuts are corroded.).
Upon ejection of the bonnet of the 2” drain valve, the bonnet hit a nearby propylene pipeline. This propylene pipe was hit in an horizontal plane above the horizontal plane of the original location of the 2” drain valve, suggesting that the nuts that failed first were the ones located on the bottom half of the bonnet/body connection.
Extensive corrosion of carbon steel nutsThe catastrophic failure of the carbon steel nuts of the valve bonnet/body connection occurred because of severe corrosion of the carbon steel nuts on the stainless steel studs.The extensive corrosion of the carbon steel nuts is a combination of galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion.
Installation of stainless steel valve with stainless steel studs in low temperature carbon steel line
The line was originally installed in 1984. According to the original specification, the 2” drain valve should have been a low temperature carbon steel valve. However, the installed valve was made of austenitic stainless steel (316). It is possible that the valve that failed is the originally installed valve.
Installation of carbon steel nuts on stainless steel studs of stainless steel 2” valveWorks on this type of valves can only be done during turnarounds since the construction of the valve (bonnet kept in place with 4 bolts) does not allow works to be done in run. There are no records about repairs of the valve (records were checked until 1998). It is not clear whether the valve that failed on 25/04/2015 is the originally installed valve or whether the original valve has been replaced or worked on during one of the turnarounds between 1984 and 2015. Possibly, the carbon steel nuts were installed during one of these turnarounds.
Valve in humid environment
The valve is constantly in a wet environment due to the condensation of water vapor in ambient air. The presence of this wet environment is a necessary condition for both galvanic corrosion and atmospheric corrosion to occur (presence of electrolyte).
Nuts not protected against atmospheric corrosionThe carbon steel nuts were not protected against atmospheric corrosion (e.g. by paint or selection of corrosion resistant material).
Nuts in carbon steelThe nuts used to tighten the stainless steel studs were made of carbon steel.
Condensation of water vapor in airThere is a constant condensation of water vapor in air at the location of the valve due to the low temperature of the fluid in the low temperature carbon steel line and because of the lack of thermal insulation on the valve.
Installation of valve not meeting specificationsIt is not unusual to install equipment parts made of more noble materials in systems made of less noble materials, provided that the compatibility of the materials is checked and that appropriate measures are taken to avoid galvanic corrosion.
Valve not thermally insulatedThe valve is installed in a thermally insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The valve as such was not insulated.
Process at -6°C. The valve is installed in an insulated low temperature carbon steel line. The operating temperature of the fluid in the line is about -6°C.
Inspection of lineThe 2” drain valve was part of lines that are inspected inside the RBI scope. The line with the valve that failed was assessed to lie in the low risk area of the RBI matrix. The lines in this low risk area are inspected by visual verification of the state of the line during site visits (frequency of these visits is every 5 years).An inspection report of this particular line from a previous inspection cycle (2009) is available. This line was scheduled to be subjected to a more detailed inspection (with thickness measurements etc.) in the next inspection cycle (to be carried out in the turnaround of 2016). A request of this more detailed inspection was applied in a pre-inspection report of end 2014. The state of the valve that failed was insufficiently detected in the visual inspections of 2009.","vessel/container/containment-equipment failure

During the incident investigation, it became clear that the risks associated to galvanic corrosion are not always clearly understood by all layers of the organization. To raise understanding and awareness about galvanic corrosion hazards, a sensibilisation campaign needs to be organized by the site. Development of formal protocol for visual inspection of valves
There is no formal procedure describing the visual inspection of equipment. To improve the quality of visual inspections during site visits, a formal protocol needs to be developed to describe the requirements related to visual inspection. This formal protocol needs to include specific a measurable acceptance criteria for each of the inspected equipment. Gas detection
The gas detection system in the installation gave a quick warning of the leak allowing prompt action by the unit operators. It took a long time to depressurise the section of the installation with the leak. Partly because of the white cloud formed by the leak that didn't allow visual verification of the leak origin. Partly because there was no block valve on the top of the destillation colomn to which the leaking valve was connected. Therefore also the following equipement needed to be depressurised. The need for an additional block valve is still under investigation."

872,Major Accident,Chemical installations - other fine chemicals,"It was noticed on 21 May 2009 that a PVC/glass-fibre reinforced
hydrochloric acid pipeline which had been in operation for several years was
starting to leak. To avoid greater damage, this part of the plant was put out
of service and replaced as a precaution with a PVC pipeline which, according to
the specification, was resistant to hydrochloric acid under the ambient
operating conditions (temperature and pressure). On 28 May 2009 the shut-down of the desorption plant was started at
10.00 as planned on account of decreasing loading. There was a leakage at around 10.10 of 32% hydrochloric acid from the
by-pass line of a heat exchanger caused by a leaking pipe. The hydrochloric
acid leaked into the plant's collection basin and was collected there. A
detector in the basin activated the alarm (on-the-spot, at the measuring
station and to on-site firefighters). Staff of the chlorosilane company were on
the spot immediately, the on-site firefighters arrived at 10.13. Once the location of the leak had been identified the feeder pump was
stopped. The leakage stopped immediately. A total of approx. 7 m³ of
hydrochloric acid 32% escaped. As the formation of acid clouds above the hydrochloric acid puddle had
already ceased, the emergency services (on-site firefighters) did not set up a

within several minutes. There was a westerly wind of around 3 m/s at the time

874,Other Event,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"From 2 to 4 October 2006 repairs were carried out at omissis nafta of the KR‑601/2 furnace in section 001 of the KT-1/1 combined
technological device for deep processing of fuel oil; these works consisted of
replacing the three worn out sections of the heating spiral in the radiation
part of the furnace. After completing the works at 8:00 in the morning of 12
October 2006 the work was begun on starting up the KR-601/2 furnace. The
burners were ignited in the KR‑601/2 furnace, the temperature was raised and
the furnace heating spirals were filled with fuel oil, which began feeding into
the K-601 column at 9:28 of the same day. Prior to connecting KR‑601/2 to the
system, the raw material was fed into the K-601 column by heating it in the KR-601/1
reserve furnace. The technological parameters of the KR-601/1 furnace and K‑601
column were within the allowed limits. The KR-601/2 furnace was connected to the system by
gradually raising the temperature of the raw material supplied to the column.
According to the technical regulation of the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar
visbreaking section 001 of the combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep
processing of fuel oil, the temperature of the supplied raw material needs to
be raised by 30 to 35°C per hour. It is apparent from the analysis of the diagrams
of technological parameters that from 12:55 to 14:24 the temperature of the raw
material being supplied was rising by 38 to 45°C per hour, meaning that the
limits specified in the technical regulation were being exceeded. Certain other divergences from the technological regime can
be seen from the diagrams of the parameters of the technological regime: - at 9:32 and at 9:48 the vacuum pressure in the column
decreased to 104.435 mm Hg st. and 67.018 mm Hg st. respectively (usually the vacuum
pressure in the column is about 20 mm Hg st.); - from 13:37 the level of tar started decreasing sharply at
the bottom of the K‑601 column, and at 14:24 the measuring devices could not
register it at all. According to the technical regulation, the level of tar at
the bottom of the column must remain within the limits of 40 to 90%; - from 14:00 to 14:23 the pressure of the cleavage gas in
separators SP-603/1 and SP-603/2 started increasing sharply (from 0.53 bar. to
-0.335 bar.); - from 10:55 to 12:25 the total amount of raw material being
fed into the K-601 column was about 544 m3/h. At 13:55 the amount of the raw
material being supplied decreased to 447 m3/h. The debit was increased,
and at 14:25 the amount of the raw material being fed into the column was 520
m3/h. At 14:30 the supply of the raw material into the column stopped
completely . - At 14:24 there was a complete absence of vacuum pressure
in the K-601 column; - At 14:30 the S-608 pump stopped pumping and was operating

to the drawing contained in the technical passport of the K-601 column, the 150
mm long junction pipe at the bottom of the column ends with a coupling junction,
however, the junction pipe is actually mounted by connecting it to the technological
pipeline No 619/1 with a welded connection. These technical modifications
are not shown in the drawings of the technical passport of the K-601 column. It
was found during the investigation that the design solution to replace the coupling
junction with a connection by welding was adopted and approved in 1987. On the
basis of the same solution, the steal containing 5% Cr and 0.5% Mo (steal type
according to GOST 5520-79), as foreseen in the initial project for the
production from the 426 x 10 pipe of the elements of the technological pipeline
No 619/1 connected to the junction pipe of the K‑601 column, was replaced
by carbonic construction steal 22K, according to GOST 5520-79. According to the
globally recognised methods against corrosion, if the technological product
sulphur content exceeds 0.5% and the product temperature exceeds 260 0C, corrosion
and heat-proof metal must be used (as was foreseen in the initial project). As
the technological product sulphur content of the K-601 column and the product
temperature highly exceeds the values referred above (2.6% and 625 0C
accordingly), it can be stated that the replacement of the type of steal was an
inadequate solution that resulted in the corrosion of the pipeline
No 619/1. This is confirmed by tests carried out during the investigation,
according to which, the metal of the wall of the separated pipe in the pipeline
No 619/1, between the parts of the vacuum column and the separation valve,
is affected by inter‑crystal corrosion and bottom layer erosion (corrosion).
The investigated parts of the technological pipeline No 619/1 were
affected by erosion (corrosion) at the time of operation and up to the moment
of fire. It is likely that the thinning of different walls of the pipe was
predicated by erosion (corrosion) before the fire. The thickness of the wall in
some places was only 0.15 mm. It was found during the investigation that, at the moment when
the fire was detected and during the extinguishing of the initial fire, it was the
bottom part of the K-601 column, located in the intermediary area of the
pedestal of the K-601 column and between feedwater heaters of the column and
section 001 of the KT 1/1 technological device that was on fire. According to the opinion of the investigating commission,
the most likely reason for the fire in the section 001 of the KT 1/1 combined
technological device for deep processing of fuel oil is the ignition of the
technological product (tar), previously heated to the self‑incineration
temperature, after this product burst out through the crack (or cracks) in the
part affected by corrosion of the technological pipeline No 619/1 between the
junction pipe of the K-601 column and the separating valve. Such cracks may
have resulted from the thinning of the wall in the part of the said pipeline to
the level that it was not able to resist the pressure load. It results from the analysis of the technical regulation of
the vacuum fuel oil rectification and tar visbreaking 001 section of the
combined technological device KT-1/1 for deep processing of fuel oil, that the
actions of the technological staff faced with changes in technological
parameters (tar level at the bottom of the K-601 column (the cube) or vacuum
level inside the column K-601) and their technological management are not
strictly regulated and the technological staff operating the device acts on the
basis of instructions from their directors or based on their own personal
experience. At the time of the accident the staff operating the device notices
any change in technological parameters (decrease of the tar level at the bottom
of the column and sudden decrease of vacuum in the column itself) attempted to
restore the parameters, by regulating the column load and the tar debit from
the bottom of the column, but at that time the product was already coming
through the possible place of dehermetisation in the part of the technological
pipeline No 619/1 between the K-601 column junction pipe and the
separating valve. It has almost been an hour (from 13:37 to 14:30) that no one
of the operating personnel passed through the K-601 column and inspected it or
the related equipment, in order to identify the reasons for the decreased tar
level in the cube of the K-601 column. On 15 October 2004 the management plans approved by the
chairperson of the board of omissis provided for the reduction of
operating costs, by extending the intervals between general repairs by at least
4 years and more, and, at the same time, for the improvement of the long-term
reliability of devices. According to the commission, this decision fails to
improve the long-term reliability of devices, as the repairs of separate
devices, without stopping the production for general repairs, cannot allow the
full taking into account of the wear and tear of the devices and their
condition. The last general repairs at omissis were carried out in
2003, and the repairs planned for 2006 were postponed. The manufacturer set a service period of 11 years for the
K-601 vacuum column (technical passport of the device, page 129, Table 2
“Technical characteristics”). The inner condition of the K-601 column was
inspected on 26 September 1997 together with hydraulic tests. Based on the
inspection and test results, also the investigations performed and conclusions
presented by the joint stock omissis, omissis decided
to extend the period of operation of the column (the fact recorded in the
technical passport of the K-601 column). The last inspection of the inner and outer condition of the
K-601 column was performed on 9 January 2006 (the fact recorded in the
technical passport of the K-601 column). According to the requirements of the
Instructions No BM-2 for using pressure vessels, the next date for the
inner and outer inspection of the column was set to 9 January 2010, i.e. the
planned frequency of the inspections was 4 years. Acting on the basis of the Instruction for the use of
pressure pipelines No BM-4, approved Order No 83 of the deputy
director for production technology and capital integration of omissis
of 23 April 2004, the pipeline maintenance engineer of the Diagnostic Facility
performs the technical inspections of the pressure pipeline No619/1 (from the K-601

pipeline No 619/1 (hereinafter referred to as IOP) and the full
verification of its technical condition (hereinafter referred to as VTC) was
performed on 15 December 2004. The inspection found some minor shortcomings,
however, it concluded that the repairs of the pipeline were not necessary, and
the next inspection dates were set accordingly at 15 December 2008 for IOP and

875,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"30 litres of water were to be introduced in the prescribed manner from a container into a reactor (in a manual controlled addition, depending on the reactor temperature) as part of a plant operator's control routine. Two shut-off valves (one metering valve and one pneumatic shut-off valve) must be closed before the water is added. The plant operator then opens the pneumatic shut-off valve using a process control system (PCS) and the water is added via the metering valve. The operator forgot to check if the metering valve was closed, so after the pneumatic valve was opened the full 30 l of water was released into the reactor, triggering a reaction, releasing hydrogen chloride and causing the reaction product to foam up. The gas-liquid mixture from the reactor escaping quickly through the exhaust pipes to the absorber increased the pressure in the reactor to at least 0.5 bar. This pressure surge resulted in the cooling coils breaking off two of the three vapour coolers. The hydrogen chloride/product mixture continuing to rise up from the reactor was thus able to penetrate through the cooling coils into the coolant pipe system and then escape through the pressure compensation tank opening into the building.

The PAAG revealed that the process for adding water must be technically restructured such that the maximum quantity that can be added at one time is limited to 3 litres. This happens through a second glass vessel with a maximum volume of 3 litres situated between the initial glass vessel and the exhaust pipes. Likewise, the shut-off valve to the reactor and the shut-off valve to the initial glass vessel are connected to each other, so that only one of them can be open at any one time. The buttons for operating these two valves are installed within sight of the valves so that permanent visual control by operators is ensured. This also limits the maximum amount that can be added to 3 litres and prevents recurrence of this operating error.
The operator carrying out the task must ensure, before the addition of water commences, that the dispensing valve is closed. This check must be consciously performed and documented from now on.
The PAAGs of other chemical reactions will be examined for potential operating errors. Findings from the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection:
One of the main lessons from this incident is that there must be a balanced relationship between recognised danger points and the measures selected to manage them. In the event of a potential loss of control over the reaction process, only inherently secure process configurations or protection through PCE devices should be selected. When designing PCE devices, the reliability and inertia of the entire system must be taken into account. Coupling of the room ventilation system to the fire alarm system.

A technician of the high pressure compressor manufacturer was contacted to establish the actual status of the damage and to determine the failure causes and consequences of the incident. The shooting out of the ""drive rod"" screw was found to be the main cause leading to the incident. There is already a practice that every year, during the overhaul, ultrasonic testing of components of the high pressure compressor, including the screws was performed. The last testing was conducted in October 2008 and no failures/defaults were observed. The testing was performed by an external company „Inženjnering komerc "" d.o.o.. In the production unit we already use the most modern control system to monitor parameters such as gas temperature in the cylinder, intake and pressure, temperature of the sliding tracks, vibrations measured on the compressor casing, temperature of the cold oil.

This brief drop in voltage triggered the closure of the BFG supply pipes, resulting in the shut-down of the main BFG draw-off points (heating-plant boilers Nos 1, 3, 5 and 6, and the combustion boilers of push furnaces 1 and 4) and other, smaller BFG draw-off points at the plant. This caused a substantial increase in pressure in the main BFG distributor (about 16 kPa), followed by the extinction of the burners on BFG stacks 2 and 3 (increase in BFG flow to maximum) and the bursting open of pressure traps on the main BFG distributor (26 traps). This resulted in a release of BFG, which was signalled by the CO monitoring system (external and internal CO monitoring at the plant). The CO release was reported at 06:45 and emergency control arrangements were put in place; the Energy Division’s control centre requested a reduction in the supply of BFG by 200 000 Nm3/hour, by reducing blasting. At the same time, action was taken by the company’s own fire brigade (air quality monitoring, adding and closing of pressure traps, evacuation of employees), and by the company’s private security service (closure of roads). After the necessary technical measures had been performed on the installations (gradual ignition of the burners of the heating plant boilers and of the combustion boilers of the push furnaces, shut-down of blast furnace No 2 – interruption of the blasting of hot air, resulting in a reduction in the production of iron and of BFG), pressure in the main BFG distributor gradually fell until a stable value of 2-6 kPa was reached.

899,Major Accident,Production of basic organic chemicals,"At May 19, during the night, an Ethylene Oxide ( EO) railcar was discharged. This situation only occurs during shortage of EO , e.g. during turnaround phases. Normally railcars are not discharged, but loaded, however the most of the EO is used internally. Prior to the unloading, a cooling unit in the storage area was taken out of production for cleaning and was re-commissioned. This operation included isolating this unit by means of ‘blinds’. After applying startup procedures the operator started the discharge operation. Such operations for safety reasons are exclusively carried out during night shifts. Initially a small batch for quality assessment was discharged into a dedicated tank without any problem. Shortly before the incident, the transport line was rechecked by the operator, valve settings were adjusted to facilitate transfer to the main spherical storage tank. Upon commencing transfer, the operator encountered problems generating a sufficient flow from the pump. Several re- checks of ( valve, pressure etc.) settings and lineups, and confirmations were carried out. After restart attempts, and increasing (nitrogen) vapour pressure in the railcar, an apparently normal pressure gradient and fluid flow was monitored. Sometime later, EO gas alarm was triggered, that shortly thereafter ceased an next was interpreted as a ‘false peak alarm’. Shortly after shift switch, the EO transfer operation was halted as a normal safety precaution. The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night. This obviously alerted senior management, and soon it was concluded that the entire transferred volume ( 32,5 tons) had found its way into cooling water discharge point via a Pressure Relief Valve. Immediately, the local emergency team was established and started the impact assessment. Simultaneously, local authorities as well as the AKZO Nobel Corporate Emergency response team were alerted, and a independent investigation of the incident by corporate and independent experts with support of the Board of Management was initiated. Important to mention is:",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to water,fluid release to water,,,,,,,,00. NAMED SUBSTANCE,"The following conclusions are drawn up on account of the investigation: Operating error plus incomplete application of Management of ChangeCombination of an operating error (leaving a blind flange in place) plus an incomplete application of a Management of Change procedure (maximum allowable operating pressure not in line with the pressure relief valve settings) led to over pressurization of the EO transport system. As a consequence EO material found its way through the relief valve into the cooling water system and finally to sea water. Cleaning the EO Cooler was executed not following a work permit nor was it planned and controlled in the strict turnaround regime.Isolating the cooler in the EO transport system by own personnel for cleaning, remained outside the turnaround (plant maintenance stop) work scope and did not trigger inclusion of these activities into the strict turnaround control routine, nor was it included in a work permit routine. Work permits are issued only for contractors working on the installations. This was one of the causes that contributed to the error in the blind flange procedure. Informal shift handover at operator level and deviation from standard operating procedures.Coordination and handover of activities to be carried out by different operators is informal and the assessment and response to operational deviations is largely delegated to operators, with no stringent requirements to involve line management. This was one of the main causes that contributed to applying higher than normal pressures on the system and not discovering the fact that an additional blind that was put in the system.","component/machinery failure/malfunction

900,Major Accident,Manufacture of food products and beverages,"    A relatively new pipe in a concrete channel has been leaking due to corrosion. Leak has led to an unstable pumping and outflow of hexane in the concrete channel. The channel has been established to collect the hexane in the event of leakage. There are no ignition sources in this channel. Concrete Canal ends at the building's outside wall between the pump and tank. Hexane could seep through the wall and formed a potentially explosive gas mixture in the room with pumps. It was not foreseen that hexane could penetrate the wall and the room was therefore not protected against explosion. The explosive was ignited by the electrical wiring in the room with pumps. An operator notices a faint smell of hexane and decides to find out why. 3 people are about to find the reason for the smell when the explosion happens. An employee who resides outside the building next to the room with pumps die. A fire arises and is extinguished by the fire brigade.

902,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"On 16 November 2010 at approximately 11:00 there was an explosion/deflagration and subsequent fire in the reactor chamber of a CPon plant. As soon as the gas warning sensors were triggered, the plant team immediately began to wind down the reactor using an elevated flare and to activate the reactor chamber's vapour barrier. Within 2-4 minutes, the alerted fire-brigade was on site and began cooling the lower third of the reactor area. As the leaking fluid (cyclopentene/cyclopentane) evaporates easily, instead of directly extinguishing the flames, the material was allowed to burn out in a controlled fashion. Around 15:30 the flames burned out in the reactor chamber and the residues from the process were burned with the elevated flare. The incident was confined to the reactor chamber. There was no harm to people or the environment. The material damages were concentrated on the reactor area, the compartmentation of which prevented the fire from spreading to other parts of the plant. At the time of the incident, there were around 40 t of a mixture of saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons in the reactor.
Around 10% of the mixture (rough estimate) leaked out through a break point caused by the explosion and was burnt.

EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE - note 3(c),"Operation-associated: the final conclusion is that the ignition of a detonatable mixture and probably very small amounts of air led to a detonation in the area of the block and bleed system in the dispensing equipment. Adiabatic compression of gas is seen as the possible cause of the ignition. The day before the incident (15 November 2010), a block valve on the reactor side was replaced. During its installation air probably got into the pipe section between the block valve on the reactor side and a second block valve, and the pipeline between the block valve on the reactor side and a control valve was probably then filled with cyclopentene (CPen) residue in gas or liquid form. This means that before the start of the nitrous oxide dosing, the relevant pipe section probably had a mixture of CPen residues and air of an unknown composition. The accident investigation concluded that the ignition of an explosive mix of nitrous oxide, cyclopentene/cyclopentane and probably very small quantities of air led to an explosion in the area of the block and bleed system of the nitrous oxide dosing of the CPon plant sector. There were also comprehensive investigations to determine the source of ignition as the potential trigger for the explosion. In two points, adiabate compression following the opening of the nitrous oxide valves could have created local hotspots. Adiabatic compression is considered as the possible cause of the ignition. No individual person actively made a mistake. The relatively new process, which is still being patented, and the low level of knowledge about the substances or mixture properties, particularly the mass explosiveness of nitrous oxide / cyclopentene mixtures is considered as the cause.

In order to prevent their cooling from leading to crystallisation, circulation was maintained in an external heat exchanger containing a double-walled pipe dating from 1984. The effluents flowing into the interior pipe were heated by the steam injected between the two walls. At about 21:00 on 21 August, corrosion of a pipe inside the exchanger led to the appearance of several holes with a diameter of 1 mm and to the steam coming into contact with the effluents. The mixture was discharged into the condensate collector tank, the outlet valve of which was rapidly closed by the automatic control system, which had detected an excessively high level of conductivity. The contaminated condensates filled the tank to the point of overflowing before flowing into the retention basin. At 17:00 on 23 August, the operator detected the overflow and reopened the valve after misreading the display, believing that he had seen a value of 6 μS/cm (below the maximum threshold of 30 μS/cm), whereas the screen had changed scales, and was displaying 6mS/cm. The effluents flowed into two drainage ditches and then joined the Tauran. In the following 24 hours, the personnel switched off the site's alarms and the ratemeter that had detected radiological activity in the discharge channel leading into the Tauran, without proceeding to dispel doubts regarding the possibility of an accident having taken place.

This was caused by corrosion linked to the presence of ammonium disulphides produced by the combination of H2S from desulphurisation and of nitrogen from denitrification in the reactor. Water is constantly injected upstream in order to dissolve this substance and prevent deposition. The unit was modified five years earlier to meet the specifications for low-sulphur fuels.

-	this type of equipment is difficult to inspect, because a single non-compliant bend out of 368 caused the accident;
-	the inspections carried out were appropriate for detecting zones of erosion in the bends, which can be found by radiography because of their highly irregular surface. However, the method was unsuitable for this type of corrosion, located downstream from the seam joint on the right side of the tube, resulting in an even surface with very irregular wear on the edge of the seam joint.

911,Major Accident,Production of pharmaceuticals,"The accident took place during hot work on the supply line to Tank TKX which contained spent stripped fermentation broth (SFB) from the production of antibiotics. This work was being carried out by a subcontract firm as part of a temporary modification to the wastewater treatment unit. There was a confined explosion of gas inside the tank which led to the roof of the tank being projected approximately 20 metres; the explosion killed one subcontractor and injured four other workers (three subcontractors and one company employee), all of whom were working on the modification. The SFB supply line had been emptied of wastewater coming from the distillery unit. The air vent of the tank, located on the roof of the tank, had been open as usual. The tank was approximately 50% full. Five workers were carrying out the work, four from the external firm and one from the company itself. The external workers had disconnected the SFB line by removing the shut-off valve on the entry duct on the roof of Tank TKX without closing it with the port's blind flange. One worker was standing on the roof of the tank near the open flange; the others were on the walkway giving access to the roof of the tank. They were beginning to cut the existing tube using a disc saw; sparks most likely produced by contact between the disc and the tubing ignited the explosive atmosphere which, unknown to them, had collected inside the tank. There was a confined vapour explosion (CVE) inside the tank which projected the tank roof approximately 20 metres.

EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE - note 3(c),"The direct cause of the accident was the presence of a mixture of highly inflammable gases inside the TKX tank, ignited by sparks caused by a cutting disc during temporary modification work. The gas came from the sediment at the bottom of the tank. The conditions inside the tank, i.e. the lack of oxygen, encouraged the formation of populations of anaerobic bacteria which initiated fermentation, thereby producing various highly inflammable gaseous compounds, such as hydrogen and methane, which are lighter than air. In addition, the presence of sulphates means that a series of other (sulphide) gases may be produced which are extremely inflammable and much heavier than air. A vent was present on the tank roof; this allowed only the circulation of the lighter-than-air gases. The anaerobic conditions which led to the formation of the gases were due to a modification to the tank undertaken around ten years previously; this closed the air vents on the tank base which were included in the original plans. During operations the sediment would accumulate on the base of the tank in large quantities and under anaerobic conditions. The area had been considered to be non-dangerous within the meaning of the ATEX Directive. The work had been decided on in order to carry out a temporary modification without, however, adequately assessing the risks. The internal hot work safety procedure (isolation, clean-up, use of an explosimeter) was not applied. The fact that the work was carried out when the tank was full meant that the ignition of inflammable gases was inevitable. Various estimates have been made regarding the exact chemical breakdown of the gas inside the tank, but analyses and laboratory simulations seem to confirm that sulphide gases in layers lower down the tank were the main components, along with hydrogen and methane from layers higher up the tank.",loss of process control,wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties,"training/instruction

Highly explosive mixtures can ignite at the slightest opportunity, particularly if hot work is carried out without taking the necessary precautions. Aeration of the tank base is vital for safety reasons and must not be done away with for any reason.
In the ATEX Directive (96/92/EC) plants with tanks containing spent broths are classified as being at risk of the creation of explosive atmospheres, and ATEX and safety procedures must therefore be used.
For modifications, even temporary ones, the risks must be analysed using appropriate methods, such as HAZOP. The risks of such work must also be analysed.
Employees and workers from subcontract firms must be informed about and trained in safety procedures, and more importantly the unit heads must have a culture of safety, i.e. the strict application of safety procedures.
Accidents of this kind may happen in future, also due to the expansion of biotechnology in different sectors. While many biotechnologies are malodorous, this unpleasant aspect cannot be eliminated at the cost of creating much more serious risks, as in this case.

913,Near Miss,Chemical installations - chlorine,"Around 10:30 pm in the isocyanate unit at a Seveso-classified chemical plant, a sensor detected a rapid conductivity rise in a heat exchanger, in which phosgene (COCl2) pressurised to tens of bar was being reheated with water vapour at 28 bar before reacting with an amine. Once the sensor alarm threshold was reached (50 µS), the safety controller isolated the drainage circuit for exchanger condensates by closing a motorised valve. A second conductivity meter, which had not been functioning properly and was scheduled for replacement by maintenance staff, displayed a value of 0 µS. Uninformed of this malfunction, technicians decided to shut off the amine intake at 10:40 pm and extract a sample to confirm their suspicions; they notified the on-call operator, who carried out an on-site assessment of the situation at 11 pm. The operator then proceeded to bypass the conductivity meter in restarting production without waiting for laboratory results to be released.
Around 11:30 that evening, external sensors detected a COCl2 concentration build-up. By 11:52, a pressure sensor on the vapour circuit was reading in the tens of bar, triggering shutdown of the unit by closing shutoff valves on both the enclosure confining the unit and the condensate drainage circuit. The quick sequence of these closure steps caused a water hammer that broke a drainage valve at the base of the exchanger; the remaining COCl2 spilled into the enclosure, lowering vacuum pressure and closing the exchanger bypass valves. COCl2 sensors inside the confinement detected a rise in COCl2 content, reaching saturation at 1:10 am (1,000 ppm).

The investigation also revealed a section of the pipe that had been replaced (and was thicker) 5 m from the rupture and the unexpected ovalisation of one end of the pipe.
The final expert report regarding metallurgical matters revealed several combined factors: failure of the impermeable membrane of the sleeve, groundwater fluctuations in the sleeve, creating environment discontinuities for the electrolyte and reduced cathodic protection, localised degradation of the covering combined with separation of the tar. After water had come into contact with the tar/steel interface, a nascent corrosion pierced the pipe, and a small release of O2 thereafter accelerated the phenomenon.

The minister for industry and the state secretary for ecology visited the site. Pieces of refractory lining, some of which having a size of 50 cm, and other debris were found up to 100 m around the accident site, a dust cloud could be seen over the site. A part from the noise of the deflagration no other off-site consequence or impact was observved. The continuous air quality monitoring did not detect any anomalies.The cylindrical steam superheater having a diameter of 5 m and a height of some 20 m is connected to a chimney of the same height, did not contain any toxic products. The explosion was not followed by any fire. Following a rain storm during the night between 13 an 14 of July with water infiltrations affecting a technical room and the digital command control system, the steam cracker unit NR 1 was shut down and secured.The day before the accident start-up procedures had been started during the morning.The start-up process is long, start-up is performed section by section.On 15 of July the superheater was prepared by 15:00 hrs in view of a manual start-up. An operator with a mobile probe went to ignite the pilots when the superheater exploded. The corpse of the operator and of a second employee were found under the debris of the collapsed bottom of the superheater.The explosion was probably caused by the accidental accumulation of a flammable gas mixture and an ignition source which could not been determined. A judicial investigation and the investigations made by the operator should allow to clarify the exact circumstances of this accident.An urgent prefectural order imposes a detailed revision of the safety report and an integrity assessment by a third party of the equipment affected or potentially affected by the accident (pressure wave, missiles, etc.) before restarting operation of the installation.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),,,,,,"- an accumulation of inflammable gas, yet within the flammability limit: the operator's investigation pointed to the hypothesis of a gas flow surge in the direction of a burner during the start-up phase as the ignition step was being carried out; - ignition of the cloud by either the tube ignitor or a hot spot inside the superheater convection zone. Other ignition sources could also be envisaged (e.g. electric spark, static electricity), yet these two cited sources would seem the most plausible. A number of elements favoured the onset of this accident, whose serious consequences were tied to the presence of personnel in the vicinity of the superheater during manual ignition: - failure to steam-sweep the superheater prior to its re-ignition, as stipulated in the operating procedure issued by the plant management; - gas input via a burner, despite the flame on the associated pilot being extinguished;",,,,,,"Causes - Plant/Equipment
Causes - Organisational","This accident led the site operator to completely modify the ignition sequence of a superheater in order to limit the risk of repeating such an accident, in terms of both probability of occurrence and consequences; these efforts consisted of: - introducing a programmable and servo-controlled automaton requiring all start-up stages to be performed, namely: o steam sweeping; o pilot ignition; o burner ignition. - setting up a control chart that comprises, among other things, the pilot lighting sequence and the procedure for remote-controlled valves. This measure made it possible for personnel to initiate the superheater ignition sequence remotely, thus limiting their exposure in the event of explosion.
Additionnaly, it stressed the fact that a safety barrier shall not be bypassed, even if its use is very rare during normal operation as it was designed for the steam cracker start up (once every 6 years, but once or twice a year according internal sources). This accident also questionned the plant's technician perception of risks and safety barrier efficiency."

934,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives","The accident occurred in a building in which propellent powders for ammunition with ADR classification UN1.3C are sieved. Sieving is one of the final processes in the manufacture of propellant powders. The sieving unit in question comprises two circular sieves positioned in series within a cylindrical housing made from stainless steel. The cylindrical housing is vibrated by forced oscillation and the spherical powder to be sieved is fed into the unit via a mobile hopper moved by hoist apparatus. At the machine outlet, after sorting according to grain size, the useable powders are retrieved in collection hoppers and waste is collected in suitable bags. In principle, the sieving apparatus operates automatically without an operator being present in the sieving hall. The operators fill the feed hoppers and empty the processed product from the collection hoppers when the machine is shut down. On the day of the accident, two operators were assigned to the sieving plant: a young employee on a short-term contract, still in training and an experienced operator in charge of training him. On 26 March 2013, the operators' first action was to dismantle and reassemble the sieving plant, as laid down in the operating procedure, with a view to cleaning it before starting the actual sieving of the powder. At around 4 a.m., a malfunction occurred in the sieving plant and a fire broke out in the machine which then spread to all the powder located in the sieving unit. The most experienced operator was in the room at that time (his attention had probably been drawn to a suspicious noise). The alarm was set off and the ultrafast-response flooding and sprinkler systems were triggered. Nonetheless, the fire spread to a second 250 kg hopper of powder which the second operator was bringing to the entrance to the room, and this generated a second fireball. Lastly, a third 250 kg hopper containing powder, probably already filtered, located outside the room and not yet removed to an appropriate storage place, also caught fire, generating a third fireball, which was observed by the witnesses that came to assist the victims. The two operators suffered serious second- and third-degree burns; they were, however, able to exit the building on their own and remained conscious during their transfer to specialised hospitals, where they received appropriate care. Despite this medical attention, in the weeks following the accident both victims died from the effects of their burns.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)","fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)",explosive decomposition (of unstable material),,,,,05. EXPLOSIVE - note 2(b),"Observations indicate that the fast-closing fasteners on the sieving unit opened during the sieving process. Since they were no longer tightened in place, the filters shifted out of their housing, causing metal-on-metal friction which - probably - caused the powder to catch fire. The sieving unit's top cover had a confining effect when the powder was burning, leading to a build-up of pressure in the machine and - very probably - a deflagration of the product that would be the cause of the displacement and significant deformation of the cover. At this point, there was a sudden eruption of flames from the sieving unit which burned the operators then in the immediate vicinity of the machine. A nut used to fasten the sieve housing which was found on the floor after the accident shows no sign of being torn off, suggesting that it gradually worked loose during the sieving operations. The operator's presence in the hall could be attributable to his having approached the sieving unit in order to investigate the cause of the problem after becoming aware of some equipment malfunction (the abnormal noise) without shutting down the machine, despite the fact that procedure stipulates that entering the manufacturing hall is not permitted when the equipment is in operation.",component/machinery failure/malfunction,wilful disobedience/failure to carry out duties,,,,"Causes - Plant/Equipment

935,Near Miss,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives","The emergency services were alerted when a chemical reaction occurred in an intermediate bulk container (IBC) which contained bulk-emulsion explosive waste. When the rescue operation got underway, it was assumed that the container could go on fire or explode. The situation was hazardous because the container was stacked together with about 200 other waste containers (about 100 tonnes waste) at a distance of approximately five metres from an explosives warehouse (about 40 tonnes of explosive substances). At that precise moment, the major risk was seen to be an explosion, whose pressure effects could extend to a radius of about 1300 metres from the warehouse.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,,,,,,,"The sensitized bulk-emulsion explosive and rock material, containing pyrite, reacted together in a steamed waste container which was situated next to the explosives warehouse. The container was originally from the Pyhäsalmi mine, where exactly one year earlier an attempt to load the blast holes in the roof of the tunnel with emulsion explosives by means of a new mobile explosive manufacturing unit (MEMU) failed. As a result of this, a significant amount of sensitized emulsion dropped onto the floor of the tunnel. The miners did not realize that the mixture of sensitized emulsion explosive and rock material was a non-conformity waste. Accordingly, the waste was handled as typical emulsion waste and was sent to Vihtavuori. The production volumes of bulk-emulsion explosives in Oy Forcit Ab have multiplied over the past few years because of increasing mining and infrastructure development. At the same time, bulk-emulsion explosives are being increasingly used instead of traditional explosives. Oy Forcit Ab has not been able to keep pace with the disposal of the emulsion waste. The emulsion waste occurs during both the production phase and the application phase. Emulsion waste containers have been stored mainly in the yard of the explosives factory and in the yard of the explosives warehouse. Tukes has requested that Forcit takes corrective actions to resolve the waste-container warehousing problem. Forcit has taken several corrective actions, but these actions have been inadequate due to the simultaneous increase in production volumes. The Explosives Act that is currently in force covers the production, use and disposal of traditional explosives.

936,Major Accident,Production and storage of fireworks,"At 10.15 a.m. on the morning of 25 ;July 2013, a series of explosions occurred in the finished products storage area of a fireworks factory. The initial explosions - three explosions in short succession according to calls from members of the public to the fire service [VVF] - presumably occurred in the vicinity of sheds No ;4 and 5, which were used to store finished products (fireworks), classified as category ;IV and V under the National legislation regulating explosive factories and warehouses. Observations of the effects indicate that the sheds probably exploded en masse, i.e. involving all the material contents of the sheds simultaneously. The fire service's findings suggest that, at the time of the explosion, several factory employees - including the manager and two employees related to him, who were killed instantaneously - were loading products from the storage sheds onto vehicles parked nearby. Ignition presumably occurred during the handling of the explosives. It seems that the products being loaded were to be transferred onwards onto vans parked in the yard in front of the entrance gates for shipment to the venues where they would be used, since the vans had been partially loaded but still had to be fully loaded. In the days preceding the accident, the factory had been particularly busy preparing and shipping products for many planned fireworks displays; in particular, a fireworks display for a local festival was planned for the following day. At 10.55 a.m. there was a fourth explosion, in a delayed domino effect, in shed No ;8, which was used to store up to 9600 ;kg of category IV and V explosive material. The shed, already damaged by the shock wave from the initial explosions, was probably struck by burning debris thrown out by ongoing minor secondary blasts, and it too probably exploded en masse together with all the contents. This last explosion caused the death of a fourth employee (the son of the manager), who was hit by section of the roof of shed No ;8, and caused serious injuries to a fire-fighter working at the scene, who later died from the injuries. In total, the event caused the death of 4 ;factory employees, serious injuries to a fire-fighter, who died in hospital approximately three months later, and injuries to 3 ;employees and 5 ;fire-fighters, who were all hospitalised and subsequently recovered. The accident caused extensive material damage, with the factory's sheds destroyed almost completely, damage to civilian facilities adjacent to the factory perimeter and related to the factory, and damage to external civilian buildings within a radius of up to 1 ;km. Debris of various sizes from the sheds which exploded was found within a radius of up to 1 ;km. Lastly, the explosions caused environmental damage as they set off a series of large-scale forest fires in the surrounding natural and rural area within a radius of 500 ;m which were later extinguished by the fire service and the State Forestry Corps, deploying two aircraft. The main local authorities (including the Prefecture, the Carabinieri, the police department, the judiciary [judicial inspection] and the local health authority) intervened at the scene. No action was apparently taken by the Regional Planning and Environment Office to measure soil contamination due to chemicals dispersed as a result of the explosions.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,"03. OXIDIZING
05. EXPLOSIVE - note 2(b)
06. FLAMMABLE - note 3(a)","In tandem with the MARS inspection, the incident is currently being investigated by the local Public Prosecutor’s Office, and the official expert [CTU] appointed by the Public Prosecutor is drawing up the official expert report. As part of the judicial investigation, the area of the factory was sealed off and the company documentation on the premises at the time of the event was seized. As a result, although MARS inspectors were able to enter the sealed area (subject to prior authorisation from the PM at the request of the fire service), they have not been able to access the company's documentation. Given the above circumstances, it is only possible to formulate hypotheses on the causes of the accident, based on the information collected and measurements taken after the event by the inspection committee in the course of its inspection and making use of the data provided by several of the public authorities involved in post-accident operations, chiefly the local fire service and the Commander of the Carabinieri. Additional hypotheses have been put forward on the basis of information drawn from the interview with the manager's representative, the appointed expert [CTP], it being impossible to consult either the manager or his employees/family members (who were killed by the explosion). Some surviving relatives are still in a state of shock and receiving psychiatric treatment. The hypothetical conclusions based on post-accident data collected by the fire service and the Carabinieri are set out below. In the process of securing the location after the accident, primed explosive products (already fitted with electric fuses but not connected to a power supply) were found in the factory yard in front of the factory entrance and in the tool shed used as a garage for vans. It was not possible to identify the kind of primers and, consequently, if they were allowed or not inside the plant according with the national regulations. In general, under the national regulations fireworks must never be pre-armed inside the establishment. Considering the material damage sustained by the internal structures, in particular by the sheds with load-bearing walls made from reinforced concrete, and the containment walls, with evidence of disintegration and crushing, the probability is that there was a sympathetic detonation of the explosive material or an instantaneous explosion involving the entire quantity of material due to mechanical stress: this can be compatible with the potential presence in the area of the explosions of quantities of explosive products already, it is assumed, unlawfully primed. It should be added that, according to the statement of the Commander of the Carabinieri, explosive material, including primed material, was also found in the area belonging to the manager's residence and, specifically, in the vans parked in the tool shed and, lastly, fireworks were found in the basement of the tool shed. Considering the above hypotheses, it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process. This aspect goes beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators who, as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials; it suggests, rather, an excessive level of ‘confidence’ gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work involving materials that in fact entail a high level of intrinsic risk. To this may be added the probable situation of working under pressure, subject to constraints of time and space, in the days immediately preceding the event on account of the many orders for firework displays which the operators themselves were called upon to carry out by virtue of their acknowledged reputation in the sector. Furthermore, given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, considering the maximum quantity authorised within a shed, it may be hypothesised that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authority. Applying the above method with a highly conservative approximation of the case leads to the conclusion that the structural damage due to the pressure wave compatible with that observed on the outside buildings damaged ought to lie within a radius of less than 107 ;m; however, damage of this kind (lifting of the building's wooden roof, cornerstone movement, curtain wall damage, partition wall damage) were found at a radius of between 100 ;m and 500 ;m from the craters made by the explosions. Furthermore, on the subject of the quantity of explosives in stock, according to information reported by the Commander of the Carabinieri approximately 20 ;days after the event (13 ;August) some 0.2 tonnes of black powder were found stored in five drums in an abandoned hut outside the factory adjacent to the southern perimeter. There were no labels on the drums. This amount, together with the 0.43 tons found in shed No ;2 following the explosion, would exceed the authorised limit of 0.5 tonnes for black powder. Lastly, we should stress the domino effect of the initial explosions upon shed No ;8, first hit by the shock wave and then ignited, presumably by burning debris. In theory, compliance with National Regulations with regard to the distances between sheds should have prevented a domino effect of this kind but only if the authorised maximum quantities and types of explosives were also respected. These considerations again point to the root cause being the breach of safety requirements in terms of the quantity and type of explosive material authorised and/or stored and processed in the establishment. This is supported by the conclusions of the incident report drawn up by the local fire service, which managed the emergency response to the event. On the basis of information obtained from interviews with surviving relatives not currently in a psychological condition to have dealings with the inspection committee, the appointed expert [CTP] representing the manager reports that the operator was regularly asked to store (Authority request) quantities of explosive material entrusted to its legal custody after being confiscated by the police. This material,may be, in general, not well identified and consequently with an unknown (and potentially dangerous) behaviour, was stored in the sheds together with explosive products manufactured by the company. In particular, at the time of the accident, the appointed expert [CTP] reports that the stores held a quantity of confiscated explosive material roughly equivalent to 6 or 7 ;tons, in storage sheds No ;4 and No ;5 (where the initial series of explosions was found to have occurred). So the appointed expert [CTP] declares that the origin of explosions is probably attributable to the chemical decomposition of explosive material delivered into the company's legal custody by the police, stored in sheds No ;4 and No ;5 together with the company's own finished products. He therefore highlights the critical significance of the storage of unidentified confiscated explosive material which, as it loses chemical stability over time, presents an increased risk of explosive decomposition.",,,,,,"Causes - Human

Emergency Response","On the basis of information collected and the reconstruction of the hypothetical chain of events , even though the judicial investigation into the accident is still under way, it is possible to point out the following shortcomings in management: it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process; beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators, who as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials, an excessive level of ‘confidence’, gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work, involving high level of intrinsic risk materials, came out; given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, it may be hypothesized that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authorities. This leads to the hypothesis of a breach of safety requirements with regard to the maximum quantities of dangerous substances kept in store and processed; it should be stressed that the safety distances laid down in the National regulations are valid and upheld only if obligations stemming from them and from safety requirements and safety procedures are also systematically complied with; attention should be drawn to the company's deficient in-house management of the emergency, including its failure to call in the emergency services in good time and failure to detect situations requiring the immediate evacuation of the premises: the failure to evacuate staff from the premises after the initial explosions aggravated the damage caused; as for the damage caused by the ejection of debris, attention should be drawn to the lethal effect of the pieces produced by the break up of the roof of shed No ;8 which, thanks to their strong but thin metal structure (sandwich panels), when ejected at high speed following the shock wave acted like sharp blades, thus causing the death of one employee. Consequently, the technical issue of the construction features of the roofs on the sheds, also raised in discussions with a police bomb expert, should be noted: although this type of roof is adequate in terms of providing protection and a preferential vent for a shed containing explosive material, it may aggravate the effects of an explosion in the shed in which it is broken into fragments; with regard to the difficulty of emergency service and fire service action during the explosions, it is noted that the presence of a second access route to the works, on the opposite side to the first access route, would have facilitated the positioning of fire-fighting equipment and the management of the emergency response and would significantly have reduced the fire-fighting team's risk of exposure to the shock wave and material debris during the operation. In this connection, the effective coordination of the team, with the fire-fighting units positioned and arranged in such a way as to take advantage the protection offered by the variations in altitude of the terrain on which the sheds were located, and the team's use of PPE (safety helmets, etc.) undoubtedly prevented the situation becoming more costly in terms of damage suffered by the fire-fighters."

The detailed course of the accident was as follows:About 7:00 a.m., after regular check of the installation, a worker reported to his superviser emission of the process solution (containing ammonium carbonate). The emission occured in the upper part of the exchanger. The person responsible for maintenace works was called in deal with the damage. In the meantime the affected exchanger was being prepared for the examination and repair. The exchanger was rinsed/washed with water. This task involved opening and closing the proper valves on a pump and injection of water. After the exchanger had been washed, the process solution was added to the installation but with omitting the damaged exchanger. This allowed the maintenance staff to remove the isolation of the exchanger in order to examine it. After the examination of the exchanger was performed, it was decided that leakness would be temporary stopped with a caulker band. In order to do this the internal recue unit was called. They noticed punctual leaks in a few places. Before they started sealing operation it was decided to rinse/wash the exchanger again (doing this twice, in the same way as for the first time). Whille the caulker band was installed inside the exchanger there was water at a low preassure. After installation of the band it was decided to check the tightness using water. It appeared that it was not tight enaugh becasue water was leaking. The worker closed one valve to stop the water flow. At the same time he also opened another valve allowing the process solution to get into the system. The other worker, not being aware that process solution was being injected, thought the tightness tests were going on so he cut (with the valve) the flow of the flow of the process solution. This caused the process solution to go the broken exchanger. Suddenly the upper part of the echanger ruptured causing the emmision of the process solution. Due to its evaporation toxic claud was formed. One warker fell down because of the gust that appeared. The other five workers were intoxicated. All of them were injured and taken to the hospital.

948,Major Accident,"Production, destruction and storage of explosives","An explosion occurred in a building in which nitrocellulose formulations were prepared, and recovered single-base powders crushed, for subsequent use in the process of manufacturing double-base spherical powders. (The process involves the manufacture in an aqueous medium of small spherical granules from fresh or recycled nitrocellulose prior to adding nitroglycerine.) Although the recovered powder crusher is not implicated in the accident, it was damaged as a result of the fire in the building. The formulations are made from granules recycled after sieving, crushed single-base recovered powders and fresh nitrocellulose in the form of nitrocotton fibres. To make the formulations, nitrocellulose granules of various origins, stored under water in tanks in the building where the accident occurred, are transferred between tanks in the neighbouring buildings and the tanks in this building via a network of piping fitted with centrifugal pumps. The nitrocellulose granules in the building in question are first pumped into a pycnometer tank to be weighed and then transferred to other decanting and formulation tanks located in the same building. The formulations produced in this way are then transferred, by pumping, to granulation tanks at a later stage in the production line, where they are dissolved in ethyl acetate. An explosion occurred in the transfer pump and the piping linking storage tank B5 with the pycnometer tank during the transfer of nitrocellulose granules in the medium of water between these tanks. The investigations showed that the explosion of wet single-base powder had created detonation conditions in the pump and the vertical pipes downstream of the pump. A quantity of powder estimated at between 10 kg and 30 kg was detonated in the accident. The detonation sheared open tanks B4 and B5 in the vicinity of the pump in question. Tank B5, contained granules recycled after sieving and was almost empty, spilled into a pit and the contents of tank B4, consisting of recovered powder in the form of monotubular grains, were partially discharged onto the building's concrete floor and were not involved in the explosive reaction. It is estimated that there were 6 tonnes of powder in tank B4 at the time of the explosion. The other tanks in the building and the pipe network were seriously damaged by the primary debris from the detonation of the pump and piping and by the blast wave. The explosion caused major damage to the building and threw debris out to a radius of 50 to 70 metres. Windows were broken within a radius of 100-150 metres. In the building affected, the explosion set off a fire in a store containing dry single-basis powder ready for feeding into the crusher.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,,explosive decomposition (of unstable material),explosive decomposition (of unstable material),,,,05. EXPLOSIVE - note 2(b),"The hypothesis that nitrocellulose in a water medium could burn and then detonate as a transition from combustion without being primed by another detonation was initially considered but then ruled out after testing. The detonation of the wet nitrocellulose granules must have been triggered by an initial detonation of dry material. It was concluded that the cause was a technical issue associated with the type of pump which had led to a possible temperature increase in the nitrocellulose granules after loss of prime and drainage of the pump chamber. The creation of a vortex in the tank upstream of the pump caused the pump to lose its prime, enabling the nitrocellulose granules in the pump to come back into contact with air and, in local areas, dry out. The hypothesis is that the dried powder trapped behind the pump impeller then became hot and detonated inside the pump chamber, transferring the detonation to the column of wet nitrocellulose located above the pump. The fact that the pipework upstream of the pump found after the explosion was not destroyed by an internal detonation supports the hypothesis that a vortex caused the pipes to be drained prior to the explosion. Hypotheses and deductions: 1) Vortex effect: It seems that the level of tank B5, to which the centrifugal pump was connected, was low at the time of the accident. In identical circumstances on earlier occasions operators had noticed a vortex effect at the bottom of the tank which could be the cause of air ingress into the pump, causing it to lose prime. During tests to try to recreate the circumstances of the accident, the operator noted: - a 50°C increase in the (surface) temperature of the pump within 15 minutes; - that the liquid column downstream of the pump failed to empty. Thus, since there is no longer a flow of liquid to the vertical column but only an oscillating phenomenon caused by intermittent discharge of the unprimed pump, the solid particles tend to drop to the bottom of the column, near the pump, where they form a blockage that stops liquid flowing back into the pump and keeping the product residues in the pump wet. 2) Sequence of events: It is hypothesised that the following sequence of events led to the accident: - Air ingress caused by a vortex led to the pump losing prime, obstructing the movement of the product through the pipes and a blockage forming in the column downstream, preventing liquid flowing back. The lack of liquid flow combined with the presence of air caused the pump to heat up and, in local areas, dry out the nitrocellulose. At the same time, nitrocellulose particles dropped into the column downstream of the pump. - The nitrocellulose particles inside the pump became drier in local areas, caught fire and detonated, causing a second detonation of the wet powder in the downstream piping. ",other,,,,,Causes - Plant/Equipment,The investigation has not yet been finalised and the causes have not been fully identified. Lessons and immediate steps: Replacement of the company's electrical centrifugal pumps (40 in total) with Venturi-type pumps. Venturi pumps operate on the principle of aspiration of the fluid to be conveyed by means of negative pressure brought about by the movement of a motive fluid (water). This type of pump means that friction can be reduced and the product conveyed can be kept wet continuously since the motive fluid is water.

951,Major Accident,Processing of metals using electrolytic or chemical processes,"Two workers were asked to change the piping and support of a feed line into an intermediate storage vessel for hydrochloric acid. The line was opened, and as they started grinding on the line support, an explosion occurred. The flame propagated back into the tank, causing a second explosion inside. The tank ripped open and was catapulted into the air, killing both victims in the process. The explosion was caused by the unexpected presence of a considerable amount of hydrogen in the tank. The hydrogen was formed in a reaction of traces of metal powder and the hydrochloric acid, and must have accumulated over a period of two months. The traces of metal powder were present in the acid feed to the storage tank. This was the result of an incomplete reduction reaction in an upstream reactor. In that reactor, the metal powder was used to remove traces of metaloxides from the acid. Since 2009, the reactor was being operated at a lower temperature than the process was designed for, resulting in a lower reaction rate. Due to the lower reaction rate, traces of unreacted metal powder were present in the feed sent from the reactor to the intermediate storage vessel. In the storage vessel, the reaction continued, producing small amounts of hydrogen, which accumulated in the top. When the piping on top was opened, some hydrogen escaped and was ignited by the sparks of the grinding. The reactor has a ventilation system, designed to remove the hydrogen generated in the reduction reaction. The storage vessel did not. The possibility of hydrogen formation or presence in the intermediate storage vessel was never identified during risk assessment studies of the installation. The influence of the operating temperature on the reaction process was never documented, and no safe operating window for the reactor temperature was determined.

953,Other Event,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"The incident was initiated when the control of six critical slide valves failed. Control over the reactor and the regenerator was lost. The situation developed into a critical condition. Air is believed to have flowed from the lower regenerator to the reactor. An increasing amount of hydrocarbons was carried with the catalyst from the reactor to the regenerator. As a result of increased supply of CO and hydrocarbons from the regenerator, the boilers shut down due to high temperature.  Smoke started to flow from an emergency chimney. There was risk of feed flowing to the regenerator and of introducion of air to the reactor via the upper regenerator. Further development was, however, prevented by the panel operator manually activating the emergency shut-down of the air compressor. This action was taken approximately 6,5 minutes into the incident. Following the emergency shut-down of the air compressor, two critical sliding valves between the reactor and regenerator were left in an open position.  Smoke continued to flow from the emergency chimney and later a fire started from the same chimney.The emergency response organisation was mobilised and evacuation of the site was carried out. Approximately 2 hours later, at 18:30, it was found that the two critical sliding valves were open. The valves were subsequently closed and the situation was clarified.There was no injuries. The accident led to a discharge of Dangerous substances, With little impact on the environment.

On

alarm for temperature went off, but was signed out without any further checking
out. Tuesday, december 2. the temperature was still on the high side, but since
the PH-measurements were high, and the steamvalves were shut, it was concluded

Whilst attempting to rectify a fault on the logic system, the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) failed totally on two occasions. ; The system was re-set after each failure. However, in between the two failures the flow control valve, FC201, situated between the failed pipe and the Dehexaniser column, and which controls the flow of the Naphtha feed into the column, was manually re-set to 15% open, the normal initial setting for starting up the column. ; This reduction in the valve opening created a greater resistance to sudden product flow and hence a higher pressure pulse in the feed line (although still within the design capability of the pipework) when the second start up occurred. ; It is likely that this increase in pressure found a weakness in the feed line as a result of the corrosion, causing it to rupture and release the naphtha product.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,fluid release to ground,"conflagration (a general engulfment fire)

of structural integrity, sampling and control modes that enable early detection
of corrosion or defects, periodicity of controls adapted to degradation

The SCl2 hydrolysed upon contact with ambient humidity, causing an intensive emission of hydrogen chloride (HCl), which was not detected by the column's HCl gas detector (the threshold was at 25 ppm). A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated. The internal fire team, supported by 40 external fire fighters, equipped themselves with breathing apparatus and plugged the leak; the cloud of HCl was overcome using 4 lateral fire hose lines. The 120 m³ of water used was collected in a retention basin to be re-used in production. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 16.15. The next day, a specialised company pumped the 800 l (1200 kg) of spilled sulphur dichloride into the retention tank and then transferred to a storage vat. The HCl remained confined in the building. The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691).
The leak was caused by a mechanical rupture in the recirculating pump of a storage tank which had been filled 50 minutes earlier. This was aggravated by the non-closure of an automatic valve at the base of the tank, despite the fact that it had been activated, firstly by the safety controller when it was shut off, and then by the shut-off at the base of the tank at 13.30. A mechanical problem was the origin of the non-closure of the valve at the base of the tank; there had been difficulties closing this for the past 10 days. The authority for the inspection of classified installations notes that the pump's performance did not appear to be suited to its requirements, considering the large number of maintenance operations that it underwent prior to the accident. For his part, the operator countered that the pump's technology had functioned for more than 10 years without any signs of failure. In addition to having the pump and the valve assessed, the operator put the following measures in place:
- The faulty pump and the valve at the base of the tank were replaced, as was the latter's actuator;
- As a preventive measure, the weight indicators (weight sensors) of the damaged tank and that of the adjacent tank were replaced;
- The cell of the HCl gas detector for the column was replaced and calibrated, as the malfunctioning of the existing detector, which had been checked 5 and a half months prior to the accident (the manufacturer recommends that this be done every 3 to 4 months) had not been remedied by re-calibration;
- The valve at the base of each of the four SCl2 storage tanks was linked to the local HCl detection system;
- Manual valves used to isolate the recirculating pump were automated and linked to the emergency shut-off system;
- A drip tray was installed on the pump's leakage controller in order to prevent splashing from the retention tank.

The accident, which occurred in an installation that had not been examined during the danger study, brought the following points to light: -the importance of detecting, controlling and assessing the consequences of changes in the nature of stabilisers and other additives added to dangerous raw materials (sulphur dichloride) by suppliers. These modifications may be a source of triggering events (crystallisation and clogging in this case) and increased risk; -Even if events that seem insignificant in the smoot
h running of the process such as the presence of glass debris from the lining of the distillation column coupled with the lack of a maintenance program on the production equipment (cleaning of the boiler) or safety equipment (clogging of the pressure sensor) do not directly lead to accidents, can have a considerable impact on the safety in downgraded modes; -a routine, unusual or exceptional maintenance operation (replacement of a pressure sensor) must be subject to a complete prior risk analysis, in order to avoid creating conditions which could lead to an accident or aggravate the initial consequences. In case of dangerous substances, these operations must be monitored and re-evaluated according to the hazards of the intervention; -the relative efficiency and the reliability of the procedures and more generally, organisational barriers (lock-out/lock-out removal); -a control system (steam valve) for a process can in no way be considered a safety system and cannot be retained as such. In particular, the production PLCs follow logic and criteria which the intervention teams are not fully aware of and which do not necessarily take the downgraded modes and lock-out situations into account. -the importance of installation design as early as the design phase (glass/metal interface); -the importance of risk analysis and failure modes, as well as technical and organisational barriers, with maximum details, for the various ""operating"" modes.

Subsequently the fire prevention coordinator inspected the affected section. When he opened the staircase-door leading to the waste water treatment room he saw that the room was filled with fumes. He alerted immediately the onsite fire brigade. The fire brigade intervened and sprayed the room with water. The lid of a batch tank in the waste water treatment plant had been ripped off and displaced. The 4 daily-service tanks placed on the tank, containing hydrogen chloride (HCL CAS 7647-01-0), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, CAS 8007-3-5), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCL, CAS 7681-52-9) and sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH, CAS 1310-73-2), were displaced and tilted.

983,Major Accident,Chemical installations - ammonia," On 26 June, about 15h45, a violent storm led to the stop with a total blowoff of the installation for ammonia production. The thunderstorm caused a complete power failure as well on the high voltage as on the low tension grid. There was consequently a stop of all the electrical motors. After the isolation of the installations, the restart was prepared during the night shift. The furnace had to be started first to have steam to be able to start the primary furnace the following day.  Towards 00:55, an explosion occured in this furnace.
At the change of shift, towards 21:00, the shiftleader was informed of the the blowdown that occured and that they were in restarting. He knew that the goal was to make 38 bar steam in order to be able to start in the morning. After various purging manipulations on the steam network, and some other works on the site, the victims went to the level of the tunnel burners of the furnace in order to check their closed position. 
According to the procedure, it is also necessary to make this check on all the other burners of the overheating section of the furnace. The shiftleader did not ask the victims to check the closed position of the valves of the other burners because during his last passage on site, he had noted that the valves of the tunnel burners were closed. He deduced from it that the closing of the burners was complete. He also checked the position of the regulation valves on the screen in the control room. They indicated 105 psi, which means that they were open. He was so convinced  that they were closed and that he read a wrong value which incorrectly confirmed his belief they were closed. Wrongly, he opened the self-closing valve of the natural gas supply. Immediately a series of alarms activated, in particular alarms on the depression of the furnace which was not sufficient anymore. In the minute which followed, the explosion occured. 
The burners valves weren’t automatic and the self-closing valve of the natural gas supply was not linked to the effective closing of theses valves. Moreover, the gas supply is common to all burners circuits without intermediate block valves.

999,Major Accident,Production and storage of fertilizers,"In a chemical plant, aqueous effluents from the production workshop for azo derivatives were released into the Petite Baise tributary via the unpolluted water system (rainwater, cooling water, etc.) and the plant lagoon. This estimated 10 m3 release corresponds to 130 kg of hydrazine hydrate, 70 kg of aminotriazole and 5.6 t of aminoguanidine formiate.The workshop was secured. To limit the consequences of this kind of release, the operator partially confined the pollution inside the plant's lagoons while lowering the rate of release into the natural environment (300 m3/hr instead of 800) and feeding clean water (900 m3/hr) into the Petite Baise to dilute the pollutant. Bleach (sodium hypochloride) was used to neutralize the hydrazine hydrate in the drainage pipes. The releases from the lagoons fell below the pollution threshold again after about ten days.The accident occurred during start-up after a routine operation to steam-clean lines and batch production equipment in order to remove the accumulated crystals of finished products. The accident was caused by leaving the connecting valves between the line connected to the steam system and the drainage system open when restarting.

1000,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"In a petrochemical plant, 72 t of gas comprising 80% ethylene and 20% ethane were released into the air at a rate of 60 kg/hr from 27/02/07 to 17/04/07, representing 5% of the site's annual VOC (volatile organic compound) emissions.A production operator making his round discovered the leak on 27/02/07 on the vent hole of the cold box housing the ethylene/ethylene exchanger (insulated by pearlite) of the steam-cracking unit. This vent hole located at a height of 15 m evacuates the inerting nitrogen of the cold box, which functions between -40 and -50 °C under 8 to 11 bar. To avoid any risk of ignition or explosion, the operator has installed 4 gas detectors, constantly measured the internal pressure of the box, monitored the development of leaks by video camera with a feed to the control room, increased the vent hole from 1"" to 3"" after installing an elbow on it to divert the leak from the installation, which was then connected to a mobile flare and put into service on17. 04.

The onsite contingency plan was activated.The odours were perceived several kilometres from the platform. ; Several dozen local residents and employees of the company felt unwell or experienced eye irritation; the personnel of a neighbouring company (200 people) were confined ; in a shelter. About fifty employees of the installation were given urinary tests fordetecting biological signs of exposure to benzene.Oily fallout mixed with rain was also observed in a nearby town, along with irisation due to traces of hydrocarbons on vehicles. The operator will pay the cost of cleaning any equipment affected (170 vehicles and 30 homes), representing a cost of 100,000 to 500,000 euros. The operating losses have been estimated at 0.5 to 2 million euros (9 days shut-down).  ;The transition stage between decoking and starting-up the oven requires 2 valves to be operated: closing one of them to permit the release of decoking gases into the atmosphere after going through a cyclone, and opening the other valve to send cracking gases to the oil quenching column downstream. At the time of the accident, a mechanical problem prevented closure of the first valve, which was not detected by the computer or the personnel. Under these conditions, the valve between the oven and the quenching column was open, leading to the emission of 6 t of cracked gas from the oil quenching sector into the atmosphere. The gas emission via the 41 m high flare lasted 25 min until the valve between the oven and the quenching column was closed manually (automatic closure impossible).The operator's fault analysis revealed a failure of the coupling between the electric motor and the shaft of the decoking valve.

1003,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"In a petrochemical plant, 60 t of off-specification ethylene was flared from 11.15 am to 5 pm following the securing of the digester of the steam-cracking unit after a lightning strike. The work carried out on one of the plant's boilers prevented removal by steam of the flaring exhaust gas; a cloud of smoke was visible from several kilometres away.The digester used nickel catalysis to convert hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) into methane (CH4) and water (H2O) at a temperature close to 230 °C. The H2 purified in this way from the CO can convert acetylene into ethylene, which is not the case when it is polluted with CO. The ethylene, which meets a relatively strict specification (5 ppm acetylene maximum) is then transformed into polyethylene.At 11.15 am on the day of the accident, a lightning strike made it necessary to secure the digester on high temperature safety; insufficient supply of H2 to hydrogenate the acetylene resulted in a high output of off-specification ethylene that had to be flared given the lack of any storage facility on the site.

1005,Other Event,Production of pharmaceuticals,"On 6 November 2012 at approximately 04:50, an explosion occurred in one of the company's batch reactors. A fire then spread towards the top of the building. According to the results of the investigation, molsidomine decomposition was the cause of the accident (molsidomine is an end product of the process and is not classified under Seveso legislation). Prior to commencing production in 2007, the company carried out tests to determine the decomposition temperature of pure molsidomine (151 °C). Given that the temperature of the process does not normally exceed 55 to 60 °C, the company believed the process operated under safe conditions. The accident ultimately occurred during the 9th production run. In reality, at the stage in the process at which the explosion occurred, 300 kg of molsidomine and 275 kg of pyridinium salts (product of the reaction between the solvent pyridine (R11) and HCl) remained in the reactor.The pyridine was fully distilled at the time of the explosion and only traces were left in the reactor. Tests carried out after the accident demonstrate that the decomposition temperature of this mixture (molsidomine + salts) is 91 °C. The TD24 safe handling temperature is 65 °C (there is no risk of explosion if heated for 24 hours) and the hazardous temperature begins at 75 °C (there is a risk of explosion if exposed to heat for 1 to 8 hours), while the reaction process takes 7 hours. The double-jacketed reactor was steam-heated and as a result it is likely that the temperature in some parts of it exceeded 75 °C (in the gas phase). The decomposition of the mixture could therefore begin and then sustain its own heatingin blobs onto the reactor wall in the gas phase. Overpressure destroyed the glass componentsof the reactor (and the rupture disk) and the blast wave spread throughout the reactor room. The fragile wall of the building was blasted away/destroyed which prevented damage being caused to the structure of the building. A few burning projectiles were propelled around the room but were very quickly put out by the emergency team and fire brigade. However, one burning projectile smashed through a glass panel in the corridor of the upper floor. This corridor was being used to store empty drums/IBCs and wooden palettes (there were no Seveso substances in this area). The fire therefore spread and caused great damage to the corridor. Given its high location (5th floor) and the fact that the exact contents of the corridor were not known (the explosions were, in fact, caused by the expansion of empty metal drums resulting from exposure to heat from the fire), it took some time to extinguish the fire. The fire in the corridor was finally out at approximately 09:00.

The bottom sensor did not detect an increase in temperature because it was there that liquid was being mixed/cooled. The top sensor noted an abnormal increase in temperature more than an hour before the accident occurred. However, the operator was unable to see this temperature as it was not displayed. Given that at approximately 04:30 the operator had observed that the (bottom) temperature was displayed as normal (< 60 °C), he went on his break whilst this stage in the batch process finished.

1013,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"At 11:15 pm, a violent and loud bursting occurs within an ammonia (NH3) synthesis unit at a SEVESO-classified nitrogenous fertiliser plant. The convex base welded to a heat-insulated, high-pressure water vapour pipe connected to catalytic reforming equipment had burst prior to ignition. The base, a 40-kg block of steel, was projected longitudinally. Inside the shop area, a walkway was ripped off its supports damaging an access ladder. The steel base crossed the ammonia confinement space 25 m further, without causing any damage, then flew over an ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land 230 m away in a parking zone for tanker cars full of ammonia awaiting shipment, which on that day happened to be empty. The water vapour, circulated at 520°C under 120 bar of pressure in the pipeline, tore apart the asbestos cement cladding on the wall located 20 m from the original rupture and escaped into the atmosphere with a load accompanying noise. The two employees present in the unit at the time cut off vapour supply to stop the sound, shut down production operations and cooled the steam reformer with nitrogen. At 11:50 pm, the plant's internal emergency plan was activated by the operator, yet he failed to sound the siren or notify neighbouring localities. Alerted by the outside noise, local residents called emergency services around midnight; first responders arrived onsite with a crew of 55 men and several utility vehicles. No intervention was required on their part. Upon hearing the vehicle sirens, some residents stepped out onto their balconies or made their way to the periphery of the plant since the municipality was unable to provide information about the ongoing incident.

OXIDIZING,"A metallurgical assessment of the base indicated that slow creep had initiated on the outer skin, which combined with flow into the material layer was the cause of pipe rupture. This hypothesis relied on the detection of oxidised, yet non-deformed, pipe openings in the presence of intergranular microcracks on both the pipe and its base. The origin of this creep was explained by the metallurgical composition of the base, i.e. ordinary carbon steel containing no alloys and not adapted to temperatures above 425°C. The pipeline was made of a slightly-alloyed P22 type steel, which was more resistant to creep and compliant with the original specifications defined 32 years prior for both material elements. Inspections carried out at the time on the convex base did not detect any noncompliance of the steel, given that non-destructive technology had not yet come of age. This creep might have been accelerated as a result of heat treatment performed at 700°C during equipment installation, once the assembly had been welded. Periodic inspections dedicated to pressurised equipment on the damaged pipe were only recorded into the log 25 years after service start-up, at the time of applying for facility recertification. The initial recertification was rendered official without any underlying structural documentation (misplaced), and subsequent inspections never focused on the section of pipe that would burst.Nine months before the accident, the in-house inspection team had requested adding the mode of ""degradation by high-pressure vapour pipe vibrations"" to the unit's pipe inspection routine, following a break in the drain valve of a high-pressure pipe when restarting operations at the unit. On the day of the accident, this mode had not been included in the inspection programme. Classified Facilities inspectors requested a materials control of all unit pipes before restarting operations; this additional step revealed 12 other noncompliant steel components (a tee junction, tap, base, flange, etc.).",corrosion/fatigue,,,,,"Causes - Organisational
Emergency Response","---Lessons Learned drawn from the FD_38831_Le Grand Quevilly_DP_vfin_GB.pdf report ----Even though the severity of this accident remained rather mild given the absence of domino effects, several lessons can still be drawn, relative to both the causes and circumstances.As for causes, this accident highlights two significant organisational flaws :• Deficiency in the control of equipments materials at the time of unit installation. Even though material certificates were verified by an independent control body according to the operator, the steel used on the bottom and 12 other pieces of equipment was not compliant with specifications, and the original pipe construction documentation could never be found.• Incomplete traceability of pipe monitoring given that until 2003, formalisation of the steam pipe condition monitoring protocol had only been partial (restricted to unit drawings). Formalisation of monitoring procedures was not initiated before the first periodic recertification, in application of the 15 March 2000 decree, though the unit had already been operating for 25 years. Nonetheless, the French regulation relative to plant pipelines (issued on 23rd January, 1962) stipulated in Article 13 that ""the documents, drawings or diagrams, testing and retesting reports, notes from inspections prescribed in Article 12, relative to a pipeline or set of pipelines, are to be archived…"".From a broader perspective, this accident stresses the difficulties found by the internal and external control entities in detecting such non-compliance in steel. As demonstrated in the inventory of all unit’s pipes, this non-compliance does not represent an isolated case. It would be useful to mention that a verification of the steel quality had taken place in 1987 but was limited to those elements prone to hot hydrogen damages. Even if the initial recertification had been conducted in compliance with current regulations (without any imposed hydraulic test, no imposed exposure, original drawings forwarded to the authorised certification body), the question can still be raised whether it was reasonable to limit this verification to just the regulatory control steps in the absence of construction specifications. The organisation of these controls, shared over time among several distinct actors (internal inspection team, certified control authorities and the various external firms subcontracted to perform specific tasks), was not designed to promote efficient monitoring given the lack of rigour in their formalisation.The operator also conducted verifications on the type of materials found on the most sensitive parts of the site's other units. The local environmental authority requested an operator of similar units located just a few kilometres away to undertake the same kind of verification. Feedback was addressed at the national level to all local environmental authority offices.As regards the consequences of this accident, it can be considered that a 40-kg steel projectile propelled through an operating ammonia production unit, passing close to an NH3 receiving bottle, missing the nitric acid unit and a bulk ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land in a zone where railcars loaded with ammonia were likely to park, all while causing relatively minor property damage, lies within the realm of “divine intervention”. This assessment was underscored in a letter written by the local environmental authority to the operator: ""… the caps, which are massive pieces of equipment weighing some forty kilograms, most likely crossed the most sensitive installations found in the AM2 unit, namely the R1501 bottle, to ultimately land between 2 railway lines at the location of switch 371. These elements attest to the potential seriousness of this incident…"".This potential seriousness was also fully perceived by the operator, with some testimonials suggesting that some plant employees became aware of the risks related to pressurised steam. It goes without saying that the site's safety reports were focused on the most common hazardous phenomena for this kind of activity, as well as those causing potential effects outside the site boundaries, though domino effects caused by pressurised steam equipments were not included.The scenario with most third-party exposure is based on a toxic ammonia leak (up to an 8-km radius around the site).This scenario recently became more predominant in employees mind given the repetition of accidents of this type arising just a short time earlier at one of the Group's sister facilities located less than 200 km from Grand Quevilly (three months before the accident : ARIA 38959; and one year before with the evacuation of 300 employees receiving significant media attention : ARIA 36660).Besides, a flaw in the implementation of instructions issued by the internal inspection team has to be pointed out.Following the incident that occurred in October 2009, when the water hammer associated with a restart had caused the rupture of a bleed valve on one of the unit's high-pressure pipes, this team had requested that the pipe inspection plan incorporate the mode of vibration-induced degradation. Eight months later, on the day of the accident, this mode had still not been included even though it would have perhaps allowed to detect the surface defect or the onset of microcracking at the level of the weld (had for example a magnafluxing inspection been carried out on the suspected weld).On the other hand and despite the communication efforts engaged by the site operator and authorities over major accidents behaviour in the past few years, this potentially serious outcome has gone unnoticed by all neighbours. Several local residents actually went onto their balconies to observe the actions of fire-fighters, while others walked up to the site boundary even though safety guidelines called for residents to remain indoors.In defence of local residents, the operator's decision to activate the internal emergency plan would have alerted them to the potential seriousness of the incident. Instead, the operator waited for 50 minutes before triggering this emergency plan jointly with the municipality and local authorities. Fire-fighters were notified well before this period, but this notification came from local residents calls, and fire-fighting crews were unaware of the exact situation when they arrived at 11:30 pm in front of the site. Moreover, the decision made at 11:15 pm not to activate the emergency siren on the grounds of an absence of toxic leaks only further sparked the curiosity of some residents upon hearing the leaking steam noise between 11:07 and 11:27 pm, inciting them to get closer to the site. In reality, the operator could not have been completely certain of the absence of toxic leaks until around 12:18 am, after the second inspection of the damaged unit and negative controls of air toxicity around the site. A final inspection of the unit with authority representatives was even considered necessary at 1:15 am to remove any lingering doubts.Alerting local residents and requesting them to remain indoors, even if not really necessary, would have provided the added benefit of reminding residents that a major accident can occur and would have tested their ability to apply correctly the preventive guidelines.In conclusion, the operator was late in informing local emergency response teams and neighbouring municipalities, which were unable to notify individuals with information regarding the accident, a shortcoming that further incited the inappropriate reaction of some residents. And yet the plant's locality happened to be one of the few in France to be equipped with an automated call system to quickly and simultaneously alert residents living near the site."
1015,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"An empty 100-m³ tank of sulphuric acid (H2SO4) exploded at 9:15 am at a chemical site. Installed directly above its retention basin at a height of several metres, this ""F2"" reservoir was projected and fell nearby, toppling the scaffolding set up for reservoir maintenance and causing 3 workers (2 subcontracted personnel) to fall. Two of the three were seriously hurt: the plant employee sustained cranial trauma after falling some ten metres; and a subcontractor was pinned between the tank and the scaffolding, injured to the face by the grinder he had been using. The internal emergency plan was activated, bringing both internal and external responders to the site. The injured were taken to hospital. The operator notified the Prefecture, local city halls and the general public. The classified facilities inspectorate initiated an investigation.
The tank had been temporarily plugged on 18th July using a sealant box after discovering a leak on 17th July. Scheduled for repair at the beginning of August following its drainage, the tank was rinsed with water throughout the weekend of 2nd August, then a subcontractor installed the scaffolding for the specific intervention: tank access, process insulation plating, etc. A plant employee, accompanied by 2 subcontractors, then assembled the tank in order to open the dome when the explosion occurred.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,,,,,VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),VCE (vapour cloud explosion; supersonic wave front),,,,04.

Because the cyclohexane is lighter than the waste water it flew over the top of the containment instead of being pumped to the waste water treatment installation. So the cylcohexane got into the internal rain water collection system and could spread further.

During the test of the main flare the operator by accidently closed the main valve of the natural gas supply instead of the valve on the supply branch for the main flare. As a result the plant was tripped because a number of devices (such as compressors) didn't function any more and was then shut down completely. As a result of this a large quantity of process gas was sent to the flare but the smaller flare's pilot flame was extinguished because of the lack of supply of natural gas.

The incident was caused by the ignition of an 81 mm HE M512A1 mortar round during the final packing operation.One side of the pallet assembly was filley with 54 projectiles of 81mm. The problem occured while closing the transport containers of the mortar rounds. The mortar rounds are transported in plastic containers that hold 3 mortar rounds in seperate tubes. The operator experienced difficulties in loading the round into the containers and closing the container caps.The mortar round sometimes protruded more than normal from the plastic container and this made it more difficult to fit the retaining cap, to rotate it and to align it correctly. A gap remained between the container and the cap.The operator found that striking the retaining cap of the container with a mallet was enough to align it and to allow the cap to be locked in position. According to the operator, the incident occurred when he struck the remaining cap with a mallet due to it being difficult to align and rotate.This was not the first time that the operator used the mallet to close the cap. One of the two operators at the packing operation had done the loading operation before but could not be considerd highly experienced since he was drafted in to performe this operation from another area of the site (machining).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,,conflagration (a general engulfment fire),explosive decomposition (of unstable material),,,,,04.

During the night shift from 24 to 25 August 2011, a fresh water inlet hose became disconnected from a hose connection during a trial operation of the plant*. The fresh water escaped unnoticed (estimated flow rate 0.5 l/s) and flooded the process bath.

Finally, the mixture escaped into the open via a hall door. *In order to produce high-quality, uniform layers, the temperature in the bath has to be kept constant. Because of this the process bath is cooled. This is done using a titanium cooling coil which is fitted inside the bath and connected to a fresh water supply (in the present case, the municipal mains) via hose connections (inlet and outlet). The heated cooling water is returned to the plant for rinsing purposes.

They discussed the dismantling of the tank, considering the roof was deformed and their concerns re: unzipping of the tank - Petroineos contracted Das Fleet (a dutch demolition company with experience of this type of work) Outcomes of their inspection of the damaged tank were that it was likely a combination of multiple causes all contributing to the partial collapse of the roof: Likely Scenarios: Crease in roof was 1m in depth24hrs prior to failure 42mm of rain fell they considered drain restriction as above - however when tested the non return drain valve was functioning as designed. no obvious damage to roof drain, at time of incident the roof drain was free running, Drain size for the service was also considered - Petroineos stated that there was no reason to assume the drain was inadequately sized. Roof drain design: roof drain runs inside of tank as the tank roof lists the angle of the drain pipe is changed leading to the drain being compromised and unable to drainwater from the roof effectively potentially leading to rainwater/product building up on roof increasing the roof loading and potentially contributing to the roof sinking through loss of bouancy.Petroineos stated that there was no evidence for this under normal operation.

1026,Other Event,"Chemical installations - sulphur oxides, oleum","(Mercaptan-type) sulphur-containing products were released from a chemical plant for 20 min at around 13.00. Emergency services took eight employees who felt unwell (nausea, headache, vomiting) to hospital from a neighbouring company. They were discharged soon afterwards. The operator did not trigger its emergency response plan.
The oxidiser of the unit producing calcium phenates stopped automatically when it was detected that the flame, which had previously been unstable, had been extinguished. It had already stopped during the night at around 01.00 but without significant impact. The stopping of the oxidiser caused that of the phenates unit, the H2S and mercaptan-type sulphur-containing effluents of which are also treated by the oxidiser (after passing through a tank in which those with the highest H2S content are converted). If they are not oxidised, these sulphur-containing effluents are released to the stack untreated. A similar incident three weeks previously affected five people at the same neighbouring company. The site was temporarily shut down as an administrative measure until the oxidiser was working reliably. The site risk assessment had not anticipated the accidental release of mercaptans. Production losses stood at several thousand euros. An expert's report showed the oxidiser flame to be outside the flame detector field as a result of combustion instability. This instability was caused by excessive dilution of the fuel (natural gas) with surplus oxidant (surplus oxygen and nitrogen contained in the effluent to be treated arriving at a rate of 8 000 kg/h). The expert's report made a number of technical recommendations to improve combustion (reduce and preheat the surplus oxidant, split the injection of fuel, etc.) and suggested that an activated charcoal filter be installed to trap mercaptans and H2S upstream of the chimney should the oxidiser stop working. The operator made these improvements to the oxidiser.

1028,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"On 23 October 2011, at about 21.00, a fire occurred at a plant used for the polymerisation of alpha-Methylstyrene (AMS) with acrylonitrile (ACN) with the help of the radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), following a deflagration when pouring the radical initiator AIBN into a preparation tank with AMS.
Emergency services were activated, the fire was extinguished by the on-site fire service, and all of the facility’s systems were shut down by 22.40. One worker suffered serious burns during the incident. The fire caused extensive damage to the facility, in particular to the electrical cables and data communication. According to statements made by the plant manager, material damage amounted to about €3 million to €4 million. The investigation found that the incident was caused by unforeseen excess pressure in a preparation tank for a radical initiator.
During a filling procedure, AIBN was released in the form of a dust cloud, which then ignited, injuring the employee working in the area. A second deflagration occurred when three open AIBN drums, which were near the reactor, ignited. This second deflagration was stronger than the first, and caused the extensive damage to cables and an electrical room. When the process control system activated the alarm, the system was shut down to put it in a safe condition. All input of material ceased, and the remaining reaction heat in the reactor was removed as quickly as possible using water in the cooling circuit.
Within about 30 minutes the remaining initiator was used up, polymerisation stopped and the reactor cooled to room temperature. Sequence of events:
19 October 2011
Following a stoppage, the reactor was put back into operation and approximately 400 litres of AMS/ACN solution was poured in to seal the output pumps. Various problems with the ACN intake valves, as well other system valves, led to operation being suspended so that the intake system could be examined.
It was subsequently established that the problems were caused by a faulty software update to the DCS system. As a result, the software update was repeated without further problems. The software error itself is not considered to be the cause or a contributing aspect of the incident. 23 October 2011
13.30: For the current production in the reactor, a new starting solution was created; the system was working normally, with no signs of any anomalies. 20.13: The shift workers determined that the reactor (due to the above problem of the inoperative intake system) was showing a pressure of 3 bars. A manual valve was opened to release pressure from the tank into the emergency release tank.
The shift workers were not aware, nor could they have noticed, that releasing pressure from the reactor led to a pressure build-up in the emergency release tank.
A subsequent calculation of the pressure patterns showed that the decrease in pressure in the reactor from 3 bars at 20.14 to 2.1 bars at 21.03 led to an increase in pressure in the emergency release tank from 1 bar to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.25: The growing pressure in the emergency release tank reached 1.2 bars, causing the white oil contained in the immersion tank to be pushed into the preparation tank.
This assumption was confirmed by analyses of the contents of the preparation tank after the incident, which revealed the presence of white oil. Furthermore, in the gas phase of the preparation tank, organic compounds (acrylonitrile) were detected. This shows that the gas phases of the emergency release tank and of the preparation tank were connected and at the same pressure level at this time. The pressure in this combined system continued to grow to 1.7 bars at the time of the incident. Approx. 20.30: A worker left the measuring station to prepare the next batch of AIBN starting solution to be added to the preparation tank. He removed four drums of AIBN from storage and placed them on a trolley, removed all four lids and placed the first drum in the drum tipper. This was normal procedure. Approx. 20.50: The first drum was swung over the preparation tank and the slide valve on the tank was opened. As the second slide valve opened, a dust cloud issued from the funnel of the drum tipper, ignited and injured the worker, who at that point was standing at the drum tipper’s control panel. A reconstruction of this situation shows that, when the second slide valve on the drum was opened, the excess pressure of 1.7 bars in the preparation tank lifted the drum out of the funnel by at least a few centimetres. The excess pressure blew the powdered AIBN out of the drum and into the surrounding area, leading to a dust cloud, which subsequently ignited. This ignition could have happened one of two ways:
a) A brush discharge onto metal parts can lead to ignition of the mixture of AIBN powder and the gas phase containing organic components, or
b) Ignition caused by brush discharge onto the inner lining of the drum.
Both possibilities could arise from the drum being lifted up by the excess pressure and the resulting gap between the drum and the funnel, if a highly charged dust cloud with a high gas velocity issues from the gap. 21.03: The shift workers at the measuring station heard an explosion and saw multiple gas detector alerts on their screens. In front of the measuring station, they found the injured worker, who was wet from the emergency shower when he came into the measuring station. They noticed a large fire in the area of the drum tipper and immediately alerted the fire service and the emergency doctor.
Because of the fire and the damage done to the cables, most of the DCS information was cut off.
The investigation after the incident showed that the injured worker had most likely opened all four drums and left the lids on a shelf on the wall.
The drum, which had been swung over the preparation tank, exhibited a large hole and was empty, and the metal rings of the other drums were found near the trolley that had been used to transport the drums from storage to the drum tipper. It is clear that, a couple of minutes after the first fire occurred, the fire caused by the dust cloud had ignited the other three drums (this was the explosion heard by the shift workers) and the cables on the wall behind the drums. 21.11: The on-site fire service fought the fire; all other persons evacuated the building.
The cables on the wall bracket led to the central electrical room, behind the wall and one floor up. Some of the cables passed through the wall through sand traps, which were fire resistant, while others led to the electrical room through Hauff cable ducts with insufficient fire resistance. 21.36: Fire under control, worker on way to specialist clinic. 22.40: Fire extinguished, although the on-site fire service posted a fire watch until the next morning.
",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,not known / not applicable,,,,,,,04. EXPLOSIVE - note 2(a),"System error / management error 1. Creation of the AIBN dust cloud with subsequent ignition:
When relieving the pressure in the reactor by opening the manual valve, the shift workers were not aware that that could overload the gas system of the emergency release tank. The occurrence of excess pressure in the preparation tank caused by opening a manual valve had not been taken into account in safety discussions, only excess pressure caused by the activation of safety valves had been considered; however, this should have become apparent due to the abnormal conditions in the polymerisation reactors.
This approach was also supported by technology experts. This problem was made worse by a process modification in 2008, when the exhaust gas line of the preparation tank was attached to the emergency release tank, i.e. before the perforated disk in the exhaust system leading to the vent pipe. In addition, the pressure indicators on the preparation tank were installed such that the shift worker could not see them when operating the drum tipper.
A HAZOP study was carried out on the polymerisation process; however, the preparation tank for the initiator was not taken into consideration, as it was not seen to entail a risk (due in part to the conclusion that excess pressure would be noticeable due to a disturbance in the polymerisation tank).
The recommendation was made to carry out a HAZOP study on the AIBN system when it is put back into operation. 2. Second deflagration and the larger fire with resulting damage to cables and electrical room:
Because all four AIBN drums were positioned and opened near the drum tipper, the first fire caused by the dust igniting was able to ignite a larger amount of flammable material, and the fire therefore became significantly bigger. Furthermore, the cable fire reached the electrical room through the Hauff cable ducts. The damage to the cables and in the electrical room meant that the facility was completely out of operation for longer.
The decision to include the Hauff system in the factory standard, with reference to the on-site fire service, should be re-examined in light of this incident. 3. The seriousness of the shift worker’s burns:
The worker was wearing normal work clothing which was seen as appropriate to the activities.
In light of this incident and the seriousness of the injuries he suffered because of it, the protective equipment for this activity and for the site must undergo a full review.

1035,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"During the night of 6-7 March 2012, a fire in an industrial park, which broke out on the roof of a nitrile-amine plant, led to contamination of the river Alz by the company operating the site. Course of events at nitrile-amine plant:
A connecting pipe between the filtration unit and fume scrubber, which is intended to relieve the pressure in an empty filtration unit, caused a liquid reaction mixture to enter the fume scrubber. The majority of the reaction mixture which entered the scrubber flowed into the waste water sewer via the overflow in the scrubber and could be contained by the grease trap of the nitrile-amine plant (approximately 4 700 kg). Approximately 1 000 kg* of the reaction mixture went through a vent stack to the roof of the nitrile-amine plant where it caught fire (most likely spontaneous ignition due to copper (Cu) catalyst it contained). During the subsequent firefighting operation, much of the water used to extinguish the fire entered the cooling water and rainwater sewers via the roof drainage. This water was channelled along the sewer into a retention basin of the central water reservoir. Approximately 8 kg of the reaction mixture was discharged into the Alz before the valve to the retention basin was completely closed. After the firefighting operation was complete, approximately 100 kg of additional reaction mixture which had contaminated the sewers was discharged over the course of 9 hours through the cooling water outlet into the Alz. Fish kill was caused along a 14 km stretch of the Alz. Three members of the fire brigade were hurt during the firefighting operation or suffered burns during the subsequent clean-up operation and received outpatient treatment.
The member of staff from the nitrile-amine plant who discovered the fire was taken to hospital for precautionary reasons and placed under observation overnight. *The 1 000 kg (approx.) of product/copper catalyst mixture was discharged as follows:
- Approximately 200 kg was contained in the retention basin,
- Approximately 108 kg was discharged into water which entered the Alz,
- The remainder (approximately 692 kg) either combusted or was also discharged into the Alz.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to water,fluid release to water,,,,,,,,09 i. DANGEROUS FOR THE ENVIRONMENT - R50,"System error / construction
At 18:53 on 6 March 2012 a ‘cloudy run’ was started in sector X, i.e. raw amine is pumped around in a circuit from the infeed through the filter until the product is clear and the next production stage (‘clear run’) can begin. At 19:19 a ball valve between the filter and the central scrubber opens. This ball valve is only needed for the ‘cake discharge’ function and may not be opened in normal operation. The ‘cake discharge’ function is only performed two to three times a year to clean the filter. The production stages in the nitrile-amine plant are controlled automatically in the control room via a process control system (PCS) in ‘step sequences’. Since the ball valve is designed as a closing valve, its basic or safety position is ‘OPEN’ (zero position). At the end of the step sequence ‘cake discharge’ the ball valve is closed again. This position ‘CLOSED’ is maintained by the PCS until the valve is activated again.
In September 2011 the PCS was converted to a new program which became operational in October 2011. Between the start-up of the new PCS and the incident on 6 March 2012 the ‘cake discharge’ step sequence was not activated. As a result of the conversion of the PCS the background information for the ball valve (‘CLOSED’) was lost. The result was that, in automatic mode, the ball valve switched to its basic position ‘OPEN’. When the step sequence ‘cloudy run’ is started the PCS checks, among other things, whether the ball valve is closed. Therefore, in order to close the ball valve, when the new PCS started up the operating mode was switched from ‘Automatic’ to ‘Manual’. At the above-mentioned time the operating mode overview which the operator can call up indicated that the ball valve status was ‘NOMINAL = A (AUTOMATIC), ACTUAL = M (MANUAL)’. Instead of a green button as in automatic mode, the operating mode overview showed a red button with the message ‘OK’.
Although the step sequence ‘cloudy run’ had been running without problem since 18:53, the operator switched the ball valve to Automatic and thus opened it. There was no safety check or locking of the ball valve in normal production operation.
After the ball valve opened the control room received various messages about rising pH levels and increasing pressure and temperature.
When the ball valve opened the pressure in the filter fell spontaneously to approx. 1.5 bar. At this pressure level the pressure at the filter in the waste gas scrubber also fell. The substance mixture entered the scrubber infeed (volume 2.5 m³) and filled it.
The scrubber infeed is open to the atmosphere, i.e. not under pressure. As a result of the pressure in the filter the scrubber infeed and the attached vent stack were completely filled in the period 19:19 to 19:38. At 19:38 product overflowed from the stack (23.5 m high) onto the roof of the building and then at 19:43 the product mixture ignited. It must be assumed that the substance mixture discharged through the stack (approx. 1 000 kg, part of which burned off) also ran off the tin roof of the plant to the building annexed (gutter, downpipe) and onto the lower-lying flat roof, as the mixture of firefighting water and substances subsequently did during the plant fire service deployment. From there it ran through the rainwater drain pipe into the cooling water and rainwater sewer (InfraServ Gendorf sector).
The scrubber infeed has a free overflow into the grease trap. Some of the approx. 4.7 t of the substance mixture ran out of the scrubber infeed through the plant waste water system to the grease trap and was contained there. The grease trap was sealed off at 20:02, so that from that time onwards no more plant waste water entered the central waste water cleaning installation. According to the operating instructions dated 4 November 2011, if product enters the manufacturing waste water sewer the grease trap must be closed immediately. Therefore the substance mixture had already been discharged through this drain before the fluid level in the scrubber had risen so far that the substance mixture could escape through the stack. Even during discharge through the stack, substance mixture continued to flow in the direction of the grease trap along the path described.
The substance mixture and the contaminated firefighting water entered the Alz via the cooling water and rainwater sewer. This led to major fish kill and damage to other life in the lower Alz along a stretch of almost 15 kilometres.",,,,,,,"The points listed below represent the recommendations made in accordance with § 19(3), subparagraph 3, StörfallV (Hazardous Incident Regulation). For clarity, the individual measures are briefly outlined as follows. 1. Segregation of the cooling water and rainwater sewer from roof areas which can be polluted by hazardous substances in the event of a malfunction.
The rainwater system of the roof areas of the building affected by the fire no longer drains into the cooling water and rainwater sewer but, by agreement with the water management office, is connected to the plant sewer system.
Similar measures for other areas of the industrial park will require a master plan approved by the authorities. 2. Monitoring of the TOC (total organic carbon) level in the cooling water and rainwater sewers.
For technical reasons the readings from TOC monitoring in the South section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes. This time lag is now offset by having the lower valve located directly ahead of the discharge point into the Alz close at the same time as the upper valve when TOC monitoring gives the signal. Thus, given the flow speed of the water, there is sufficient time to contain any polluted water which has already passed the upper valve by closing the lower valve.
The readings from TOC monitoring in the East section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are also displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes for technical reasons. It is currently being examined whether additional TOC monitoring can be installed at a point upstream in the system. 3. All-clear for contaminated sewers given by the plant fire service only after analyses have been carried out.
To prevent any product residues from being washed into the Alz together with cooling water following firefighting operations, where sewers have been loaded with substances toxic to fish or generally hazardous to the environment, in future they will not be given the all-clear until analysis has shown that no products are present. 4. More specific operating instructions and training of staff in the wastewater treatment plant.
The technical and organisational measures taken will be set out in more precisely worded operating instructions for the staff in the wastewater treatment plant. The staff will receive training and instruction twice per year. At the most recent training session it was again pointed out what measures must be taken when certain limit values are reached and in what sequence the valves must be activated in hazardous situations. 5. Shortening the closing time of valves in the cooling water and rainwater sewer.
The stretch of sewer which is closed off by the upper valve has a diameter of 1.2 m.
At normal water levels only approx. 10 to 15 % of that diameter are needed. The basic position of the valve is now set such that only the diameter actually needed is open. This shortens the closing time of the valve. 6. Review of firefighting water retention system.
The plant’s local firefighting water retention system was checked in accordance with the applicable regulations.
The central water retention system is state-of-the-art. It was found to meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in full.
Nevertheless further investigations are currently being carried out to technically optimise the installation, in particular as regards substances which are insoluble and lighter than water. 7. Isolating cooling water from products hazardous to the environment.
In the plant all points at which substances with a fish toxicity of ? 0.1 mg/l are cooled by water are being converted to isolated (primary/secondary circuit) or circulation cooling. 8. Review of all safety equipment in the plant.
All plants in the industrial park will undergo a renewed check and assessment on the basis of the inventory of substances present. The existing safety measures will be reviewed on the basis of the results obtained. If necessary further measures will be laid down. 9. Re-examination of other measuring and monitoring methods.
It is being investigated whether cutting-edge metrology exists with which the sampling of flowing cooling water at varying water levels can be improved even further."

1043,Major Accident,General chemicals manufacture (not otherwise specified int the list),"At approximately 07:00 in the foam production area, a TDI pipeline (in the cooling system) connected to a heat exchanger (plate-fin heat exchanger) was opened.
After the circuit had been running for approximately 15 minutes, a pressure relief valve was activated and fluid (cooling water) was released.
The TDI circuit pump was shut down and the TDI pipeline to the heat exchanger was closed off. Initial troubleshooting by staff. From approx. 08:30 supported by specialist firm which carried out the installation. The cause was identified as using the wrong pipelines. When the heat exchanger was fitted the product inlet (TDI) and the cooling water outlet from the heat exchanger were mixed up.
This resulted in a short-circuit between the coolant (ethylene glycol/water) and the product (TDI). At that point it was not apparent that coolant had entered the TDI tank. It was not possible to foresee the subsequent effects of this. At approx. 11:30 the operating crew noticed that steam was coming out of the tank storage facility. They then inspected the tank storage facility and found that the steam was coming out of one TDI tank and that the tank had a raised temperature.
The production management then immediately informed the company management. In addition, the production manager at a subsidiary site and the European Isocyanate Producers Association (ISOPA) emergency call centre were contacted for advice.
The steam generation in the tank section of the storage hall had now become stronger and the temperature and pressure in the tank continued to rise. It could also be seen that material (liquid and foam) and steam were being released from the tank as gas escaped.
Since it could no longer be ruled out that gas could also be released outside the tank storage building, at approx. 12:43 the operating crew called the public fire service.
At approx. 13:00 the first members of the public fire service, police and rescue service arrived at the site. The public fire service was assisted by two works fire brigade units on site.
At approx. 13:15 the competent authorities and the appointed external accident coordinator were also informed by the company management.
Side by side with the emergency services deployed at the accident site, an emergency and crisis management team was set up in the administration building on 13 August 2013 for internal risk protection and emergency management. The team was made up of company operations managers, the accident coordinator, external emergency services and representatives of the authorities. Since the TDI contents of the damaged tank continued to display an exothermic reaction and thermal instability, to reduce the heat of the reaction the tank and the entire TDI tank storage building were permanently kept under a water curtain by the emergency services. Following the installation of various additional temperature-measuring devices, the reaction in the damaged tank could be measured and monitored, inside the tank and on its outer wall continuously by the emergency services in a safe room.
The TDI tank affected had a double wall, which meant that the water curtain had only a small heat-dissipating effect. As described, the tank had to be cooled for several days by spraying (water curtain). Following the provisional all-clear on 16 August 2012, on 17 August 2012 the temperature rose again significantly, possibly as a result of the reduced spraying. The situation did not stabilise until 18/19 August 2012 as a result of the sustained cooling. To be safe, the public emergency response services continued cooling by spraying (water curtain) until it was clear from the temperature readings that the reaction had stopped. The investigation and clean-up work could then begin. The damaged TDI tank was inspected by specially trained fire service staff and other experts at the end of August 2013. The purpose of the inspection was to obtain a better assessment of the residual risk for salvaging the damaged tank and as a result determine the subsequent recovery procedure.
Following a thorough examination, by agreement with the company operations managers, the local emergency services and representatives of the authorities, the tank and its remaining contents were disposed of safely with the aid of a specialised firm in September 2013 using a special industrial cleaning method (suction method). At the same time the expert appointed by the investigating authority began investigating the cause in accordance with § 29a BImSchG (Federal Immission Control Act).",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,,,,,,,"The cause is human error (repair work):

- Installation of a TDI monitor which gives an acoustic and optical alarm on site if a limit value of 0.5 ppb is exceeded.
- Reduction of the TDI storage capacity.
- Replacement of the traditional heat exchanger with a safety heat exchanger. This ensures that no coolant comes into contact with TDI or enters the TDI circuit, and that no TDI enters the cooling circuit. Organisational measures:
- Setting up of an emergency service (alarm system sends text message to mobile phone).
- Review of the plant alarm and contingency plan and introduction of a local incident commander.
- Review of operating instructions, such as conduct in the event of an alarm in the TDI part of the plant, operating instructions for the organisation of the emergency service, goods-in checks and unloading TDI tankers, operating instructions for the TDI monitors, instructions for outside firms.
- Review of and training in the ‘work permit’ procedure: for work involving particular risks, such as working at height, working with hazardous substances, etc. a work permit must be issued and all the necessary data documented.
- Review of the inspection and maintenance plan: drawing up an inspection register with all routine inspections. As a precautionary measure to limit the effect of incidents, a number of technical and organisational measures were laid down and implemented.

EXPLOSIVE - note 2(a)","The polyethylene (PE) polymerisation unit had been modified 2 years prior to the accident; moreover, a system for treating the VOC stemming from degassing of this unit (cooling and condensation of the heaviest compounds) had been installed. The compounds remaining in a gaseous state (ethylene, vinyl acetate) were then piped to a fan, with a flow rate of 25 to 50 kg/hr. At the fan outlet, these compounds entered a VOC recovery duct (L: 300 m, d: 1.5 m). Initially, this duct solely transported a mix composed of air and a small proportion of degassed VOC from the PE bead storage silos (< 10% of the lower flammable limit). The site's 2 boilers, which were supplying steam to both the site's steam cracker and flare in order to remove black smoke, burned the gaseous mix being fed through the duct. This process enabled eliminating a large portion of the VOC generated by the polyethylene production process.
The investigation conducted by the operator revealed that a liquid hydrocarbon mix (solvent and vinyl acetate) had formed inside the polymerisation VOC recovery pipe before being propelled by the fan into the boiler supply duct, where this mix accumulated. An inflammable atmosphere had thus been created in the pipe section adjacent to the boilers. On the day of the accident, this atmosphere caused an explosion in the air inlet to one of the boilers; this blast spread to the duct section near the fan.

First a compressor on the synthesis gas circuit was shut down following a malfunction. When the compressor stopped, there was a slight increase in pressure (25 -> 29 bar) upstream (at the low pressure end). Normal pressure is roughly 25 bar, and the system is protected by a 30 bar pressure relief valve. The pressure of 29 bar, although not too high for the installation, caused the connecting pipe to break on account of heavy wear resulting from undetected corrosion under the insulation. A leak of hydrogen (25 bar) occurred (at roughly 15.30), and caught fire at about 15.45. A flame jet approximately 10 metres high then damaged various surrounding installations (domino effect). Equipment containing oil that became engulfed by the flame jet also caught fire.

MAIN FACTORS WITH DESIGNATION OF SEQUENCEtechnical defect in the process,loss of control over the external cause processfailure to supply cooling water,organizationALhuman factoroperator error - unconscious neglectThe direct cause of the propylene leak was a loose flange connection at the inlet of the safety valve located on the pipeline bridge.The main cause of loose flange joints between the safety valve and its shut-off valve was the excessive and devastating vibrations caused by the turbulence of the safety valve. The main cause of excessive and destructive vibration was most likely resonance induced by the acoustic standing wave on valve discharge and natural frequency. The calculations show the resonance with the outlet pipe. While other factors may have a causal effect on the occurrence of chatter (eg low flow) and subsequent vibrations (eg pipeline support project), the massive vibration intensity with such a devastating force, as evidenced by the extent of damage to the safety valve, could only be attributed phenomenon such as acoustic resonance.

The main cause of the furnace fire was the crack on the sixth hairpin, which was not properly cooled by process steam. Following a crack on the filament, a hydrocarbon flashing occurred in the reaction section and in the hot section and then the flare of the hydrocarbons in the conventional section and the spray line, and finally the washing oil flare as the furnace separated from the hot section to ensure that the hot section was secured before the next fire of the other portions of the ethylene unit .The main cause of improper cooling of the furnaces after emergency shutdown was the loss of process steam when two high-pressure steam boilers for the ethylene unit were dismantled and at the same time lost the steam import for the furnaces after heavy explosive burns caused by the tearing of the medium pressure steam pipe into the pipeline bridge .","vessel/container/containment-equipment failure

The pipe connects two process vessels that are under negative pressure in normal process conditions. The level indicator was installed in the gas phase of the pipe.

It was the only maintenance work to be done on this gas line.  ;Due to time pressure, the need to empty the gas line was reassessed. It was decided that the removal of the sensor could be done without emptying the line and connected vessels based on the facts that the sensor was mounted in the gas phase and the connected vessels under vacuum.

Since monday 10th there had been operational problems with the H2S-reactor, sludge had accumulated at the bottom of the reactor, and this was being removed by blowing pressurized air to the bottom of the reactor.
Two morning shift operators discovered that H2S values on top of the reactor were too high, and communicated this to their colleagues in the shift, but failed to register the information in the shift log, and also forgot to inform about this at the shift handover.
The ;afternoon shift was undermanned, the shift leader was off duty and was replaced with a coordinator from another shift. This coordinator also had other duties on this shift, which was not allowed according to internal procedures, and a third person took over his role, but this was not communicated to the shift. They were als two operators short, and two students who were on a placement program also followed the shift. There was also an operator trainee on the shift. One of the regular operators (operator 1) had been working for many years at a neighbouring plant, but had his second day at work ;in this plant. ;
At the start of the afternoon shift, the daily tasks were discussed with the coordinator. Blowing the H2S reactor with ;pressurized air was one of the tasks, and the new operator was given information on how to perform this job. He took with him the trainee and the two placement students to do the job, and was followed by a trained operator (operator 2). The two operators climbed to the top of the reactor, and the trainee and the students were told to wait at ground level, but this was misunderstood and they also climbed to the top of the tank. Entering the top of the tank the two operators felt a strong smell of H2S, but as they had not been told about the high H2S-values during shift handover, they did not bring with them protective equipment. Seconds after the trainee and students had entered the top, one of the students fainted. The new operator reported this to the control room.

1090,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"The operator has set up an internal committee of enquiry into the accident. Information gathered to date by the committee of enquiry suggests that the incident took place as follows:At around 08.57 on 15 May 2017, an external firm represented by its owner and two other people arrived at the Eltmann plant. A plant employee took them to the hardening shop.The external firm drove a cargo van directly to the hardening shop building. The mobile filter unit was unloaded directly adjacent to the hardening furnace in the area of the salt quenching bath. Apparently, an empty IBC (1,000 litre) container was delivered at the same time. This was placed next to an existing IBC container containing demineralised water.At 09.42, according to the hardening furnace records, the safety gate to the salt quenching bath was opened, presumably in order to place the lances of the filter unit in the salt quenching bath. The pump attached to the filter unit by the external firm was connected to the compressed air network. The compressed air connection was still in place when the emergency services arrived. An examination of the remains of the filter from the filter unit’s second container, which did not explode, and of unused filters found in the external firm’s van, showed that these were cellulose filters.The first filter run appears to have been successful. However, it is highly probable that following this first run, successful or not, the filter unit was flushed with water. Following the accident, one lance was in the empty IBC container and the other lance was in the container with demineralised water. According to the hardening furnace log, the safety gate to the salt quenching bath was also closed again at 10.06. The accident was reported at around 10.15.This flushing process was the probable cause of the explosion.During this process, in order to flush the (cellulose) filter clean with demineralised water, cold water came into contact with hot salt (hardening salt AS 135), which solidifies at 135 °C. The salt bath itself has a temperature of around 180 °C and it can be assumed that the salt deposited in the filter unit was still hotter than 100 °C.The operator’s committee of enquiry is currently assuming that the injection of demineralised water and its sudden vaporisation upon contact with the hot molten salt led to a rapid increase in pressure, which caused the nitrided cellulose to decompose. The additional pressure that this created caused the filter housing to burst.Safety measures:Immediate deployment of the on-site fire brigade and other local fire brigades and emergency services.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,not known / not applicable,,not known / not applicable,,,,,00.

1092,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"On 17 May 2017 a fire broke out at the refinery site due to the spontaneous ignition of iron sulfide in a vacuum column of the Atmospheric crude oil and vacuum distillation unit.
Course of events‘A vacuum distillation was shut down as part of a planned interim stoppage.The maintenance stoppage is undertaken as an ‘intermediate stop’ in the middle of the running time of 6 years or so between two full-scale shutdowns of the whole refinery, for example to change catalysts that cannot be run at sufficient power for 6 years.
In the lower part of the vacuum column (Zone Bed 6), coke deposits build up during operation, which gradually reduces the material flow through the bed, which means that the performance of the column diminishes. For this reason, it was planned, inter alia, to replace bed 6.This work is carried out routinely every three years. The column has already undergone similar maintenance five times in the past.
In the run-up to the maintenance stoppage, there were no particular changes to the vacuum column. The pressure loss through the packing had reached the expected value. The yield structures at the end of the operating period also show that operation was undisrupted and as expected during the past running period. There was no difference in the material load compared to previous maintenance intervals; the refinery processes a fairly constant crude oil quality. In particular, there were no elevated concentrations of sulfur.
The column system was shut down in accordance with the shutdown procedure.
Subsequently, in accordance with a prior risk assessment, the preparatory works for opening the column were carried out.
The heading ‘Cleaning of the column by a specialist firm (decontamination)’ is of particular importance. This procedure involves pressurising the column with steam and water, to which a treatment product is added. The specialist firm promises that this will deactivate pyrophoric iron sulfide in the column (FeS2).Iron sulfide always forms in such columns to varying degrees depending on the sulfur concentration in the crude oil and the running parameters of the column.However, as this had been stable during the preceding running periods, it can be concluded that the mass of pyrophoric iron sulfide present is roughly the same. As the iron sulfide formed in the vacuum column has pyrophoric properties when exposed to air, this step is carried out before the column is opened in order to avoid a fire when oxygen enters.
This procedure was also successfully completed in previous maintenance stoppages.It is a standard practice in the industry.The instructions to the contractor given via the work authorisation slip and work package preparation in the stoppage planning software stipulated that after opening the lower and upper manholes to vent the column, manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11 would also be opened.
In the daily instructions to the company for 16 May 2017, the manhole covers were to be put into place after opening manholes 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11. (Explanatory note: As the manhole covers are very heavy, swivel devices are sometimes used to move them. Putting into place in this context means that the manhole lids are swivelled back to their original position, but are not secured by bolts. A narrow gap remains between the manhole cover and the column.)The instructions also stated that if it proved necessary to run water through the head recirculation line, manhole 11 would have to be closed with two bolts.
This part of the instruction was not correctly carried out and all manhole lids were wide open on the morning of 17 May 2017.
Preparations for entering and carrying out the work inside continued.At 11:38 on 17 May 2017, a smouldering fire was reported inside the vacuum column. The evacuation of the installation triggered by the alarm was disciplined and speedy.
At 11:40, the fire brigade was at the scene to investigate the situation. It was found that the escape route of three members of the maintenance contractor’s staff on a platform at the head of the column was not free. In response, the refinery’s site emergency plan was put into effect at 11:44. Neighbouring businesses, authorities and the public were immediately informed.
The fire brigade maintained visual contact with the three employees until they were rescued and used water to fight the fire and cool the column from outside. At 12:55, the employees were able to be rescued using a nearby crane with a passenger bucket. The delay was caused by the fact that the crane operator had quite properly left the plant during the evacuation and a new crane operator had to be called.At 13:14, the emergency doctor was able to carry out an initial examination of the people who had been rescued. Together with the crane operator and five other production and fire service staff, they were taken to nearby hospitals as a precaution. The last staff were released from hospital the following day.
The fire was extinguished by feeding in steam from the bottom and firewater from the top.At 14:50 the fire was under control and the refinery’s emergency plan was stood down. A post-fire inspection was organised.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,not known / not applicable,,,,,,,02.

Other","Optimisation of the decontamination procedure for pyrophoric substances in sub-installations.
Measures laid down for repairs:

Prerequisite for entry (inter alia): an erected crane with the means to accept passengers and a crane operator are available (secondary escape route/means of rescue for staff on the column if the way down is blocked).
Detailed instructions for opening manholes.
Detailed response to the risk of spontaneous ignition by means of various measures, including keeping the beds moist.
Plans for a gas monitoring system with remote monitoring for early detection of a fire.
Additional gas analysis as cross-check.
Temperature control in the column.
Provide a clear indication of the placing and securing of manhole lids 11, 8 and 5 so that, in the event of a fire, there is no leakage of firewater and fire-fighting is effective.
Instructions for fire-fighting in the event of failure of these measures.
Additional information on PPE (due to moistening, it is wet inside the column and it rains water contaminated with dirt and cleaning agents).

The implementation of the above measures, irrespective of the effectiveness of the additionally planned chemical treatment of iron sulfide, prevents spontaneous ignition and, in the event that ignition does take place, enables effective firefighting and thus ensures the protection of staff.
Measures to improve plant safety:

Ensure an appropriate risk assessment with the mapping of the appropriate mitigation measures.
Risk analysis documents are available throughout the refinery via a common database.
In order to address risks from pyrophoric substances, the safety measures under the Guideline for safety-critical organisational measures are to be identified and implemented without fail.
To further ensure that the procedures arising from the management system are properly implemented, there is a quality control through which the quality of risk analysis is verified by means of an audit programme. The auditors come from another part of the refinery.
In addition, a guide for chemical decontamination will be developed, which will also be discussed and communicated across companies in the refinery sector. One of the aims is to develop a checklist with appropriate measures to check the quality of decontamination.
A further aim is to increase the operator’s and industry’s knowledge of the basis and effect of this process, so that the competence of a service provider in relation to the whole process can be thoroughly assessed.
At the highest levels of the organisation, more emphasis is needed on cross-disciplinary thinking as part of the safety culture (‘away from narrow, silo-based thinking’) so that workflows can be understood and planned across the board.
Other organisational measures relate to deepening awareness of risk analysis among key staff, in particular the importance of prerequisites for mitigation measures (such as the fixing of important manholes) as well as better training on the rules for entering restricted spaces.


The extinguishing plan for fires inside the column has been adapted.
Improvements to damage limitation measures (secondary fire safety).

1093,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"At a refinery, a water tank with a containment capacity of 30,000 m3 holding rainwater and wastewater containing hydrocarbons overflowed at around 2.30 p.m. after exceptional rainfall. The excess water was carried to the outfall, a section of the Marseille-Rhône canal. That section of the canal is permanently protected by three booms. These booms allowed most of the oily water that had overflowed from the tank to be contained. However, the weather conditions were so severe that some of the water travelled further. A slick measuring 5 ;km long and 500 ;m wide was found in the Étang de Berre lagoon and in the Marseille-Rhône canal and oily deposits could be seen over a 1 km stretch of Jaï beach. Birds coated in hydrocarbons were found.
The operator launched the internal emergency plan and put out a press release. The local municipalities and prefecture were alerted. The emergency services and refinery employees put in place additional sorbent booms and steered vessels through the slick so as to disperse it.
Jaï beach was closed and 40 people (refinery employees and subcontractors) cleaned up the shore.

The alarms pointed to an explosion in the filter recovering dust from the unit’s ventilation network and the opening of that dust filter’s explosion vents. A fire then broke out in the filter.
The internal emergency plan was launched. The fire was brought under the control by the internal fire team and the fire brigade.
There was significant material damage and the unit was shut down for three months.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,,,not known / not applicable,not known / not applicable,dust explosion,,,,,E1. Hazardous to the Aquatic Environment cat. Acute 1 or Chronic 1,"Because of very adverse weather conditions (thunderstorm, high winds), the installation had been shut down at 7.50 p.m. – i.e. a few minutes before the accident – in line with the procedure in force.
The explosion detection system indicated that two events had taken place 2 seconds apart:

a small explosion in the vicinity of the cyclones used to treat the air from the spray drying tower;
then an explosion, followed by a fire, in the dust filter on the 4th floor. This filter was linked to the air-locks under the cyclones via the ventilation circuit.

An expert investigation revealed that this chain of events had originated in the air-lock under the cyclones. An explosion had occurred within the air-lock. The explosion can be explained by the simultaneous presence of oxygen (since the air-lock was filling up at the time of the accident), dust at an explosive concentration (presence of particularly fine dust in suspension during the filling-up stage) and ignition energy. The most likely hypothesis concerning the ignition energy is that an electrostatic ignition source was present. The relatively high temperature of the fungicide with the unit in shut-down (up to 104 ;°C as compared to 70 ;°C during production) might have made the product more sensitive to such a discharge. In addition, the low air humidity during shut-down might have led to significant generation of static electricity. The hypothesis of the product self-igniting has been ruled out as the temperatures needed for self-ignition of a dust layer are far higher than those reached at the time of the event (220-250 °C versus 104 °C).
The explosion in the air-lock was probably followed by:

propagation towards the cyclones situated above the air-lock, causing combustion of the product in the cyclone legs;
propagation of an ember from the air-lock explosion towards the air-lock’s gas vent and then to the dust filter via the ventilation pipes. As the air-lock was filling up, the vent valves connected to the ventilation system were open. The dust filter contained dust at an explosive concentration. The ember from the air-lock caused the filter to explode and then go on fire.
",electrostatic accumulation,,,,,Causes - Plant/Equipment,"After the accident and before the installations were started up again, the operator:

improved monitoring of the temperature on exit from the spray drying tower, particularly during shut-downs;
replaced the polymer filter vents with metal vents (since they have a more accurate opening range under pressure than polymer vents).

Other improvements are planned for the coming months:

making it possible to inject water into the filter from a remote area so as to reduce the risks in the event of an explosion (reducing human consequences via a more remote intervention area and reducing material consequences via more reactive extinguishing);
studies on:


the possibility of putting in place additional temperature controls (on exit from the cyclones, on exit from the filter) so as to detect problems early;
the feasibility of a smouldering fire detection system so as to detect combustion earlier;
the feasibility of putting place additional automated security systems (emergency shut‑down) if an explosion is detected in the dust filter or if the filter’s vents are open;
technical solutions to reduce the risk of ember transmission between the air-lock/cyclone legs and the air-lock/dust filter;
the possibility of reducing the quantity of product in the air-lock (so as to reduce the likelihood of electrostatic discharge).

1106,Major Accident,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"On 1 September 2018, at approximately 5:11, a large amount of flammable liquid (light cracked petrol (LCP), boiling range 20-140 °C) was released spontaneously at a refinery site.The cause of the release was a crack in the container wall.
At the time the event occurred, the installation was operating normally.The reactor’s internal pressure was approximately 24 bar, the internal temperature ranged from approximately 130 °C to approximately 148 °C and the flow rate of the feedstock LCP was approximately 32 t/h (immediately before the event, at approximately 5:05, the flow rate was increased from 30.8 t/h to 32 t/h). All in all, the reactor’s operating parameters immediately prior to the event do not show any anomalies, in particular any increase in pressure or temperature.
As the reactor is designed to have a pressure of 38 bar at 300 °C, the above-mentioned operating parameters at the time of the event do not indicate that the reactor was overloaded.
Due to the release temperature (130-148 °C, which is partially above the boiling point of components of the feedstock LCP), a large cloud of explosive vapours immediately formed. The solvent vapours were mixed with air by the horizontal air coolers in the area of release and blown upwards. The rising explosive vapour cloud was ignited at height, presumably on the uninsulated hot surface of one of the installation’s columns (outside of the hazardous area).An explosion occurred, causing the significant quantity of flammable liquid present on the ground to ignite into a large fire. Although the release of the petrol vapours was detected by the gas sensors in the processing plant, the vapour cloud explosion occurred immediately afterwards (rapid sequence of events).
As a result of the explosion and resulting fire, in a neighbouring installation (an ether installation) another reactor also ruptured and the product (mainly butylene) was consumed by fire (or by a smaller explosion). ;This installation is still closed off by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, so the cause has not yet been confirmed. ;
Presumably, the first explosion shifted/deformed an air cooler in the ether installation in such a way that pipes connected to it were deformed (a pipe with a safety valve or a flare line, as the case may be), the pressure safeguards were no longer sufficient and the reactor ‘burst’ due to excess pressure or heat as a result of the intense fire surrounding it.
The on-site fire brigade and other emergency and rescue services that were called to the scene fought the large fire resulting from the explosion and the release of a large amount of flammable liquid and prevented the fire from spreading to other refinery installations and storage tanks. The above-mentioned second (‘smaller’) explosion occurred shortly after the emergency services arrived on site.
As a result of the explosion and resulting fire, multiple installations were destroyed or seriously damaged and rendered unusable. Buildings on the refinery site (including a control room and a fire station) were also destroyed or seriously damaged. Damage to approximately 100 ;buildings in the surrounding area was also reported. Due to the large amount of smoke produced, approximately 1800 ;people were evacuated from the refinery’s surroundings.
In total, approximately 30 ;people were on site at the time of the event.
Eighteen people were injured, six of whom had to be hospitalised. Several people were given psychological care.
The emergency services took immediate and effective action to prevent the fire from spreading.
The on-site fire brigade, which was first on the scene, immediately called on other emergency services from the surrounding area. Up to 600 emergency and rescue personnel were on site.
No additional emergency measures in response to the event were required. After the event, the accumulated firewater was assessed in accordance with VdS ;2557 and in line with the requirements of TRwS ;779.

The internal emergency plan is to be revised and updated to ensure that the operator’s reporting requirements are fulfilled. ;
The electrical equipment in the whole plant is to be checked promptly by a suitably qualified employee. In addition, thermographic measurements are also to be taken.The implementation of the checks is to be documented.
All electrical and mechanical components that are liable to overheat in the event of a malfunction are to be checked regularly at intervals of no more than two months by means of thermographic measurements. The results are to be documented. This interval may be adjusted in response to the actual frequency of faults being detected.These checks are to be carried out systematically. The management system is to be updated accordingly. Operating procedures are to be drawn up or existing ones amended.
Across the whole site, any contaminated firefighting water in the event of an incident is to be contained safely using state of the art safety equipment. For this purpose, the operator is to check whether the firefighting water containment capacity available in the individual hall sections is sufficient. Where necessary, steps are to be taken to increase the firefighting water containment capacity.

In this context, attention should be paid to the following:

Measures to contain firefighting water are to be carried out in accordance with good engineering practice in safety matters.
All indoor pipes, such as rainwater pipes and other openings to the sewers, are to be protected up to the necessary damming level for firefighting water retention by fireproof bunding or protective tubes made from chemical-resistant, non-flammable materials so that in the event of a fire, firefighting water cannot flow unchecked into pipes or openings.


The pumps used are tools within the meaning of the Industrial Safety Ordinance, as the pump is an integral part of an electroplating system and is used to pump substances around that system.These tools are subject to damage from the atmosphere prevalent in the electroplating system and the substances to be pumped. To be used, they need to be operated, maintained, dismantled and monitored.The employer must assess the risk arising from the use of tools and take the appropriate safety measures accordingly. This also means taking into account the hazards arising from the use of the tool within the working environment. The manufacturer’s instructions on testing cycles, among other things, give rise to the following measures for testing tools:


The risk assessment pursuant to the Industrial Safety Ordinance should be revised and documented with regard to the issues raised above.

1117,Near Miss,Production of basic organic chemicals,"The railcar loading station for vinylchloride monomer (VCM) of the plant consists of eight railcar connections (loading arms). Only four of these can be used at the same time.
The normal loading procedure is to fill eight railcars (first four, then the other four) and afterwards all eight railcars are moved out of the loading area in one movement with a locomotive.
Due to a defect of the plants locomotive, it was temporarily replaced with a rented smaller locomotive, which was unable to pull eight full railcars at once.
The loading station is safeguarded with a derailing device, that is interlocked to ensure it is in place during loading. This should prevent entering the loading station with the locomotive during loading activities. This interlock was bypassed by the operators, so that after the first four railcars were full, these could be moved (with the smaller locomotive), while the other four railcars were being filled.
Due to a miscommunication between the operators on November 23, 2018, the first and last four railcars were not uncoupled from each other, when the locomotive was used to pull away the first four filled railcars. So the locomotive moved the four full railcars and the four remaining railcars that were being filled over a distance of several meters.
As a result, the loading arms of two of the four connected railcars broke, releasing a big cloud of vinylchloride monomer, that was being pumped through the loading arms. The bottom valves on the railcars closed automatically as a result of the railhooks being pulled loose.
The vapour cloud triggered the gas detection in the storage bund next to the loading station, which automatically shut the bottom valves of all VCM storage spheres, preventing the further release of VCM.

Even before the staff could reach the ground, around 09:01, there was an explosion-like bang at the open manhole followed by a fire ball. A fire then broke out.The subsequent root cause analysis revealed the following sequence of events:- The introduction of impact energy at the start of the work when opening the retention cover of the column filling initiated a reaction of the polymers.- Decomposition reaction of the stored acetylene compounds and terminal triple hydrocarbon bonds.- Reproduction of the decomposition reaction in the polymerisate (‘deflagration in solids') within the column, resulting in the formation of combustible gases (including H2 and other volatile aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), soot, and reaction heat.- reaction heat (= decomposition energy) resulted in the evaporation of the residual moisture (water) and hydrocarbon compounds included in the polymerisate.Evaporated substances escaped from the column as white vapour and formed a flammable/explosive atmosphere outside the column.- Build-up of pressure in the column from the vapours and gases formed.- Pressure in the column causes the retention cover to come loose with a jolt and fly out.- Spontaneous release of pressure as the vapours streamed out from the column, taking with them the aggregate from the filling.- Ignition of the gas cloud outside the column due to sparks from the flying filler debris.- Fire outside the column fed/maintained by continuing flow of combustible gases formed by the ongoing (decay) reactions inside the column.It is assumed that there was no fire inside the column because:- Flames were coming out from/at all openings of the column so that no oxygen could enter the column;- the jacket of the column is undamaged; in the event of an internal fire, at least the external corrosion coating (zinc epoxy resin) would have had to show signs of melting.- Deposits taken from another manhole are still combustible.Safety measures:Immediately after the explosion and outbreak of fire, the fire brigade was called and further action was taken in accordance with the site emergency plan and the company emergency plans.Water was also sprayed into the head of the column through the existing condensate feed in order to dissipate the energy being released in the column.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,"fireball (burning mass rising in air, often after BLEVE)",,runaway reaction explosion (usually exothermic),,,,,00.

Incorrect fitting of the metal fabric hose, which led to the release of the substance.
Lack of awareness within the firm about good practice, or of noticing and being willing to speak out if good practice is not followed.

When carbon disulphide is unloaded, the entire load is normally transferred to two storage tanks. The member of staff carrying out the unloading was not aware that the unloading process did not lead directly into the storage tank, but via an intermediate tank.At a low ambient temperature, carbon disulphide becomes viscous, which results in the flow becoming blocked, the intermediate tank reaching its maximum filling level and the flow pump stopping.Only when the contents of the intermediate tank have flowed out can the pump be restarted.
Due to poor communication between the firm and those responsible for unloading, and to the lack of knowledge of the staff member during the unloading, it was erroneously assumed that the transhipment operation was finished.
The release of the carbon disulphide occurred at a point where the metal fabric hose was damaged, directly adjacent to the unloading gantry.There was a sharp kink in the hose immediately after the flange connection. This is where the leak occurred.Sharply bending, compressing, twisting or kinking a metal fabric hose is to be avoided.

1150,Near Miss,Chemical installations ,"At 07:30 on 16 November 2018, the fire detectors installed in the vitamin B6 production building activated the fire alarm on the third floor.Immediately afterwards, the evacuation alarm was sounded at 07:31 and the building was evacuated.The site fire brigade attended with two appliances. For safety reasons, water was sprayed onto the roof of the building to precipitate escaping vapours.As the safety valve of the affected reactor (on the roof) had tripped, any release of hydrogen cyanide via the roof had to be controlled. This made it possible to prevent a hazard for the surrounding area.
The site fire brigade then triggered a broader alarm and raised the alert state from level 1 to level 3. As a result, the operator’s staff organisation and the municipal fire service of Grenzach-Wyhlen were alerted.The fire detector was triggered by the release of reaction mass from a container. In the production area, high concentrations of hydrogen cyanide in the ambient air were detected in the immediate vicinity of the release (beyond the measuring range of the portable 100 ppm detectors).In other parts of the building (other floors and the measuring station), the measurements remained in the lower range from 1 to 3 ppm.
At 07:54, the situation in the production area was under control. The containers concerned were not pressurised and the escaped reaction mass was distributed in the production area.At 08:00, a D2 message was sent to the Operations and Situation Centre and to the Freiburg regional government office, which was also informed by telephone.At the same time, a press release was issued to the local press.
The industrial measurements team measured hydrogen cyanide at various measuring points around the site. At all measuring points, zero was measured, including on the site of a neighbouring company, where a person claimed to have noticed a bitter almond smell shortly beforehand.
The police arrived at 08:24 and conducted interviews as appropriate. In consultation with the divisional police commander, it was confirmed that there was no need to alert the population.A conversation was held with the municipality at 08:50 to ensure that information was flowing as it should.
At 08:35, the D2 final notification was given. A final press release was issued at 09:05.The main part of the building concerned was released by the fire brigade at 09:07. Part of the staff organisation continued to work from that time until 18:00.Until then, further information on the state of play was sent to the Freiburg Regional Government Office.From 18:00, the plant was brought into safe condition, following a prior risk analysis, and then switched off. The contaminated roof with a gravel layer was covered with a tarpaulin so that rain would not wash the contamination into the rainwater system.
Cause/sequence of eventsThe oxazolamide in quinoline solution was supplied at a temperature of 146 °C (as in normal operation).As intended, it was then cooled to 90 °C. 1,375 kg of phosphorus pentoxide was added as intended from a steel container via a charging hopper.
During the dosing process there was an exceptionally exothermic reaction in the stirrer container with a temperature above 203 °C and pressure rise of more than 0.5 bar.This led to the release of reaction mass via the feed line into the production site and the scrubber system.The safety valve on the roof also tripped.
A quantity of approximately 500 to a maximum of 900 litres (conservatively estimated) of reaction mixture was released. This consists of: approx. 45% quinoline, 40% oxazolnitril/oxazolamide, 15% phosphoric acid / phosphorus pentoxide. Traces of hydrogen cyanide are also present in this mixture.
Safety measures:After the phosphorus pentoxide was introduced into the stirrer tank, the shut-off valve (gate) of the stirring tank closed. A safety valve tripped due to the further pressure build-up in the stirrer tank.The fire alarm was triggered by the release of the reaction mass in the production area.

E2. Hazardous to the Aquatic Environment cat. Chronic 2","The investigation into the root cause or analysis of the event follows various sources of error and cause. The possible causes are:

problems with the quality of raw materials (phosphorus pentoxide, quinoline);
a different composition of the intermediate product and thus the composition of the reaction mixture in the reactor involved;
water as a trigger for the violent reaction with phosphorus pentoxide;
operational errors in the operation of the installation in question.

These possible issues give rise to different hypotheses, of which any one or several in combination may be the cause of the event. The facts and results have been analysed in a cause map.
The most likely cause of the event is the abnormal composition of the intermediate stage (excessive residual water moisture) in combination with the reduced drying due to the incorrect indication on the pressure gauge. This means that sufficient water was still available to react vigorously with the phosphorus pentoxide and possibly also with the oxazolnitril that had already formed.
Combination of technical failure (pressure indicator) with previous abnormalities in the process.",unexpected reaction/phase-transition,,,,,"Causes - Plant/Equipment
Causes - Organisational","A number of measures to make the process safer have been identified. Measures will also be implemented that do not affect the actual, most likely cause, but also further minimise all other possible and conceivable risks due to technical defects and operator errors. This will further reduce the residual risk.
An analytical control of the approach to oxazolnitril (in-process control) for the water content immediately prior to the addition of phosphorus pentoxide is important here. If water in this process can be sufficiently excluded by analysis, an uncontrolled reaction of water with phosphorus pentoxide cannot occur.The sampling point will be selected in an appropriate manner and the method of analysis will be qualified according to the current standard.
In addition, various additional level measurements will be installed in the installation and piping system to indicate the presence of water from cooling backflows, etc. and to alert staff promptly."

1154,Major Accident,Chemical installations ,"On 7 January 2019, at around 11:10 a.m., a substance leaked in the tank store of a production plant. The leak occurred from a pipeline between a storage container in the tank store and the production plant.
The substance that leaked was oleum 65%. This is concentrated sulfuric acid in which sulfur trioxide is dissolved. The substance reacts violently with water, causes severe chemical burns and can irritate the respiratory tract. Due to the cold, wet weather conditions, a fog formed around the site of the leak. The wind speed was about 0.2 m/s, so the fog occurred only in the vicinity of the leak site.
At around 10:45, the transfer of oleum from a railway tank wagon began. For this operation, a vehicle of the on-site fire brigade is on standby at the transfer point in order to be able to intervene immediately in the event of any leakage. For this reason, the leak, which was not linked to the unloading operation, was quickly detected and remedial action was taken immediately. After the leak was detected, the transfer process was stopped and damage limitation measures started.
The site fire brigade was alerted and precipitated the fog with several fire monitors and water curtains. The competent authorities (professional fire brigade, Darmstadt Regional Council, police and waterway police) were informed of the event by fax at 11:28. In this report, the event was classified as reporting level D 2 (impacts outside the factory boundaries cannot be ruled out). In addition, the Frankfurt professional fire brigade was asked to assist. Using additional water monitors, it supported the factory fire brigade in precipitating the fog. A total of five water monitors, one extinguishing support vehicle and three water curtains were used.
In parallel with the on-site operation, a team was set up in the Site Situation Centre to provide coordinated information for the press and to advise the public via a helpline. Representatives of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade and the police were also present in this team.
At 11:51 a.m., the reporting level was increased to D 3 (risk likely or already present outside the factory boundaries) due to the emergence of a light wind and the public was warned by the sirens installed at the plant. Staff in neighbouring warehouses were instructed to vacate their premises.
Most of the water used to precipitate the leak was collected in the tank storage facility’s collection area. Water that fell outside the collecting basin entered a sewer via the surface drainage system, which drains into the municipal sewer. The outlet to the municipal sewer was shut and the water was thus retained on site. After analyses showed no pH change and no significant sulfate contamination, the water was pumped from the collecting basin and sewer to the site’s biological waste water treatment plant via the chemical waste collecting system.
The firm drained the contents of the pipeline in question into a storage container and the pipe was rinsed with sulfuric acid. This made it possible to stop the fog formation at around 13.00. It was established that the leak occurred at a pressure measuring device. After the fog formation ceased, staff of the site fire brigade wearing chemical protective suits replaced the defective measuring instrument with a new device. The subsequent pressure test of the pipe confirmed that the installation was leak-tight.
After the successful pressure test, the professional fire brigade gave the all-clear via the sirens at 14:27 and ended the operation. A total of 26 on-site fire brigade and 55 professional fire brigade staff took part in the deployment.
In the course of the operation, the footbridge passing through the plant near the tank storage facility and the road to the north of the plant were closed by the police.
The environmental monitoring team of the Frankfurt professional fire brigade carried out measurements of air in and around the plant during the release of the substance and after the leak had ended. None of the measurements detected a concentration hazardous to health.
Representatives of the Darmstadt Regional Government Office and fire safety inspectorate enquired by telephone and on site about the event and the measures taken.
It was estimated that no more than 100 kg of sulfur trioxide had leaked.
During the deployment, there were no reports of injuries within the plant either among staff or among firefighters. However, the response team received one report of a child developing a cough outside the plant.

The steam supply was re-established at around 5.30 p.m., but it was not enough to end the flaring, as several boilers remained idle. The operator’s strategy of steam load shedding consisted in cutting the steam supply first to the flares, which was necessary to improve combustion, and then to the production units. Flaring was finally reduced by restarting the production installations and starting up the secondary boilers.
The loss of electric power was caused by defects in junction boxes between two sections of thick buried cables. An expert is examining those boxes to determine the causes of the defects.
The fire in the furnace of the steam cracker unit started when the tubes where the hydrocarbons circulate broke and fell to the bottom of the furnace. It would seem that the hydrocarbons then caught fire. The loss of steam shut down the furnace suddenly, which in turn led to thermal chock and damage to the tubes.

1182,Major Accident,Chemical installations ,"An employee wanted to clear a blocked pipe between a container and a pump (filter press). He closed the ball valve on the container (holding 15,000 ;litres) and opened the pipe before the pump.
It became apparent that the valve was not completely closed, so when the pipe was unblocked the raw zinc sulfate (ZnSO4) solution was released from the container.
As the valve could no longer be sealed, the employee opened the drain valve of the container and emptied it into the collecting tray.
Safety measures:
A large proportion of the solution was transferred to the collecting tray.
However, part of the solution ran into the raw materials hall via the open pipeline before the pump. Despite the plant’s containment measures, approximately 500 l passed through the western gate into an open space in front of the hall. From there it passed via the plant’s drain system into a six-chamber tank.
All nearby drain inlets were immediately sealed with drain covers. However, one drain inlet was blocked by a pallet.
When this was discovered, the outlet of the six-chamber tank was immediately sealed off from the sewer system (22:45). The possibility cannot be ruled out that waste water contaminated with zinc (Zn) entered into the public sewer network via the six-chamber tank.

instrument/control/monitoring-device failure",,,,,"Causes - Plant/Equipment
Causes - Organisational","The following measures are the result of an expert opinion issued in accordance with Section 29b of the Federal Immission Control Act. They have been approved by the Düsseldorf Regional Government.
Measure 1:The newly installed ball valve must be included in the zinc sulfate installation’s testing plan. Testing must cover at least the functionality of the measurement and control equipment (position feedback) and the leakproofness and mobility of the ball valve (due to interference from sediments).The testing cycle will initially be set at 1 year.
Measure 2:The ball valve position feedback must be shown in the P&amp;I diagram. Until the next revision of the P&amp;I diagram, a redline revision in the master copy will suffice.
Measure 3:The procedural instructions ‘Production and purification of raw zinc sulfate solution’ must be extended to include a passage describing the procedure for purging a blockage in the pipe from the container to the filter press. It should at least describe how to purge the blockage and what to do if a simple purging does not work. Training must be given on what to do in the event of a fault, and evidence of this training must be documented.
Measure 4:The opening of pipelines containing hazardous substances must be described in separate procedural instructions. Training must be given on this, and evidence of this training must be documented.
Measure 5:The operator must demonstrate that, even if the entire contents of the container is discharged, no other substances stored in the wettable area that have material incompatibilities with the raw material solution (e.g. zinc dust, reactive sludges) make their way into the raw material solution. This proof can be provided by a member of staff with comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter (demonstrated by relevant university studies) by 1 October 2019.
Measure 6:The floor in the raw materials hall is not sufficiently resistant to raw material solutions. The area beneath the pump is not currently visible, as the pump operates in an elevated position. As a high-performance forced conveyor, vibrations in this area cannot be ruled out during the pump’s operation. It is therefore necessary to check whether the floor beneath the pump has been damaged by the incident in such a way that it can no longer be guaranteed with sufficient certainty that the pump is mounted securely.
Measure 7:During the incident, some of the raw material solution was able to flow freely through the rear hall gate into the yard. Following the incident, in order to prevent the yard’s asphalt surface from being contaminated by raw material solution from the container again, the operator added a raised edge, in the form of a threshold, to the floor at the rear gate in order to increase the retention volume of the raw materials hall. The threshold is exposed to mechanical loads due to site traffic (forklift trucks). The threshold must undergo regular visual inspection to check for damage. The proposed interval for these inspections is monthly. This inspection must be included in the zinc sulfate installation’s testing plan.
Measure 8:At the time of the incident, pallets bearing sales goods had been placed in the outdoor area behind the raw materials hall. The raw material solution that ran through the gate was able to enter a drain hidden beneath these pallets unnoticed. After the incident, the operator marked out restricted zones in the areas leading to the drains, into which, due to the gradient leading away from the raw materials hall, leaked raw material solution could run in spite of any and all measures taken. Management must check at least weekly that the designated restricted zones are always kept unobstructed. Staff are to be instructed that the restricted zones must be kept unobstructed. This instruction is to be documented.
Measure 9:The plant drainage plan must be revised. The drains running from the inlets in the yard behind the raw materials hall to the six-chamber tank at the SO2 installation must be recorded and shown.

He immediately called the emergency services.Duration of the incident: 10 minutes.
The planned addition of the secondary initiator led to an increase in pressure and temperature in the reactor vessel and then to the release of pressure via the rupture disc into a catch tank (with a volume approximately 2.5 times that of the reactor vessel) and then, in turn, to a release of pressure into the atmosphere via a rupture disc in the catch tank.

Bolting shut any unused manholes/handholes on the tanks.
Dispensing is to stop automatically if it is not confirmed by a worker that the reaction has started.
Setting out the criteria in the production specifications/batch protocols for determining whether the reaction has started.
As with the reactor vessel, the start of the reaction should be shown in the PCS.
Assessing the accumulation of pressure during the course of the reaction in order to ensure that the rupture discs are of a sufficient size (maximum accumulation of 15%); reviewing existing procedures; for new procedures before the Research &amp; Development Department starts production.
In the short term, implementing an automatic trigger for the addition of an inhibitor.
Modifying the catch tank.
Installing a cyclone separator downstream of the catch tank.
Reviewing and evaluating the catch tank with a view to optimisation; implementing any necessary improvements.
Reviewing and revising the production specifications and the batch protocols.Risk analyses (HAZOP) for defined reference procedures to define requirements for process control technology and safety-oriented controls.
Drafting and implementing instructions for identification of key safety data for new procedures by the Research &amp; Development Department before production starts, as well as determining the responsibilities and other content.
Risk analyses should be carried out before new production procedures become operational in the production process; instructions setting out actions and responsibilities should be drawn up and implemented.
As part of the HAZOP studies and the revision of the explosion protection document, the issue of “adding a solid to a container of flammable liquid” should be considered and safeguards should be put in place.

 ;SIA’s Accident Investigation, icl. Recommendations 
//SIA= Safety Investigation Authority. In Finland the Safety Investigation Authority investigates all major accidents regardless of their nature as well as all aviation, maritime and rail accidents and their incidents
There were two major industrial fires in the Finnish region of Satakunta in late January 2017 and SIA investigated the accident together. Only one of them occured in Seveso site. ;Chapters 3 and 4 contains information about the Huntsman’s accident. Analysis, conclusions and recommendations are common to the two different industrial fires.

 ;
The SIA's recommendations (The Safety Investigation Authority):
The Safety Investigation Authority made ;safety recommendations for the improvement of industrial fire safety and the prevention of similar accidents:
1. The ;SIA recommends that, together with the Rescue Department, the Ministry of the Interior ensures that, in their rescue planning, industrial premises prepare for fires identified as longer-lasting or more extensive, or other dangerous situations of this kind.
In their rescue plans, neither industrial plant had prepared for extensive, long-lasting incidents requiring special management measures, cooperation, a range of preparations and, for example, the arrangement of replacement personnel and maintenance.
2. ;The ;SIA recommends that the Rescue Departments’ partner network plans arrangements based on which the use of foam as an extinguishing agent is always fast and thorough, and ask the rescue departments to implement such arrangements.
Water is the primary extinguishing agent in rescue operations, but water is not very suitable for extinguishing burning liquids. Strong preparedness to use foam is required in such situations. The need to use foam should be identified as soon as possible and the foam should be fired quickly, based on a simple command.
3. The SIA also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplements the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.
Plastic pipelines were running along the roof of the titanium dioxide plant and the fire spread rapidly along them. Burning plastic fell from the pipelines onto the roofing material, which caught fire.

1209,Near Miss,Chemical installations ,"Power failure in the Trafogruppe 3 hydrofluoric acid plant caused by a hardware error in an S5 remote control system, with subsequent failure of the visualisation systems and manual plant shutdown.
A resulting increase in pressure in a hydrogen fluoride (HF) drum to over 10 mbar led to the release of HF in the production hall. This was condensed using a deluge system (inside the production building).
Taking into account the effectiveness of the exhaust gas scrubber and the exhaust gas fans – which could be kept powered and in operation throughout the incident apart from the short interruption between the central power failure and the manual switchover to the emergency diesel generator – as well as the monitors (outside the buildings), the additional water curtain installed by the plant fire service and the readings of the emission measurement device before the stack, the total amount of HF emitted to the atmosphere can be estimated at 2.6 kg.
The emission measurement device can display four digits, up to 9,999 mg/m³, with deviations of less than 10%. Between approximately 5:00 and 5:30, staff read values between 700 and 800 mg/m³. Taking into account the fall in HF release of approximately 18% within the first hour following the production stop, it is possible to calculate maximum HF concentrations of approximately 1,040 mg/m3 at the start of the power failure. Based on this, a conservative estimate of the amount emitted from the start of the power outage until the end of the water deployment inside and outside the building would be 4.1 kg HF (1,040 mg/m3 x 1,500 m3/h x 2.6 h).
The transfer of the power supply for safety-critical power units and equipment to the back-up power supply (diesel generator) was delayed due to a parallel failure of the UPS (230 V). The UPS would have been necessary for the automatic transfer of consumers to the emergency power supply. Instead, this had to be done manually. In addition, the manual switch for the emergency coolant supply failed. The continuous HF vapours (up to 2,700 kg in total over approximately 4 hours following the cut-off of the raw materials) had to be absorbed in the operational exhaust gas scrubber in the end, as the emergency scrubber installed for such an event did not work due to the non-opening butterfly valve in the inlet pipe.
The spread of these HF vapours was prevented by condensing using stationary process water monitors and water curtains provided by the plant fire service. The water used to condense the HF vapours was all sent to the internal waste water treatment plant and treated in accordance with the approved discharge parameters.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,,,,,,,H1.

INTRODUCTIION

An incident occurred, as from 20/09/2020 on the cryogenic ethane storage tank, resulting in ethane releases to atmosphere from one of the two tank relief valves until 25/09/2020. Total quantity of ethane released is evaluated at approximately 40 t over a period of 5 days.
Liquid ethane is stored in a cryogenic tank (capacity 11 000 m3, operating temperature - 88°C, operating pressure 12 mbarg). Tank pressure is controlled through :

- Boil-Off Gas (BOG) compressor (reciprocating compressor, OEM Burchardt), compressing ethane off gases from vaporization to fuel gas or furnaces,
 ;
- Flare compressor (centrifugal compressor, OEM Sundyne), fall back for BOG compressor to flare,
 ;
- Ultimately 2 relief valves (set pressure 30 mbarg), located at the top of the tank (~30m height).

The investigation with experts indicates as root cause an overpressure of nitrogen in compressor crank case during operation leading to (excessive) oil leakage through oil packings and oil ingress into gas packing vents. Gas packing vent is connected with compressor suction, which explains oil in suction lines.

Flare compressor :

The first failure of the flare compressor on 20/09/2020 (damaged impeller) is due to:

1) a not visible damaged impeller during overspeed testing at the manufacturer, inducing the start of crack forming in the impeller of the flare compressor
2) frequently operating in a certain speed range (rpm) in combination with a high process flow through the compressor inducing internal instability

The second failure on 22/09/2020 (damaged shaft and bearings) is due to:

1) Operating flare compressor with a (too) high process gas flow, caused by a (too) high temperature of the process gas (-14°c instead of -88°c). This high temperature was caused by a standstill of the inlet piping during 5 days, where process gas was heated up from the environment

1224,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"

A fire occured in the compressor house of the methanol plant. In this compressor house, in addition to containing equipment for compressing the synthesis gas (H2, CO2 and CO), there was also located a steam powered turbine generator with belonging equipment. When the fire started, the methanol plant was shut down. The attempted emergency stop of the steam powered turbine generator resulted in a total breakdown of the generator. Several components loosened from the turbine, were flung out with great force, and hit pipelines for the lube oil system inside the compressor house. This caused a lube oil leak, which ignited.The fire did not spread to the other systems in the compressor house. The incident had a major accident potential and could have caused serious personal injury or death as well as substantial economic loss.

",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,fluid release to ground,,not known / not applicable,,,,,,,No substances,"Direct cause: The direct cause of the turbine breakdown with subsequent fire was that isolation from the steam network at the intermediate pressure level failed to function as intended during emergency shut down of the system. This happened because a back flow valve did not function as intended. The back flow of steam increased the rotation in the turbine, which again caused that components loosened from the turbine and were flung out with great force.
Underlying causes are: The criticality of the valve was from the start of the plant wrongfully classified as low. This mistake had not been identified in later system reviews of the maintenance system. Due to this, only temporary repairs had been made on the valve that should prevent back flow of steam from the steam pipelines to the steam turbine, even though they had experienced problems with the valve for a long time. Nine corrective jobs had been performed on this valve during the last year, the latest work order on the valve's actuator had not been performed according to the deadline, and because the valve was not identified as safety critical this delay was not evaluated. ;",component/machinery failure/malfunction,,organized procedures,,xx,"Causes - Plant/Equipment

The self ignition was probably caused by accumulation of biomass (mainly insects) in the air inlet filters. This accumulation caused too high temperatures in the filters over a long period of time, and has probably also caused a change in the self ignition temperature of the hotoil.
The ; company report states that the incident was not caused by a single technical or human error, but was a result of several direct and underlying causes: design, decisions, operational practices, organisational conditions, conditions related to training, management and control, which together resulted in extensive damage to the plant. The direct cause of the fire was auto-ignition of the filters in the air intake of gas turbine generator no. 4 (GTG4), due to temperatures that were much too high over a long period of time. The underlying cause of the fire was the fact that the anti-ice heat exchanger was used outside its intended area of use, causing this high temperature.

1246,Major Accident,Processing of metals,"At 16:15 an explosion occurred followed by a fire in a 370 m³ detarrer in the gas treatment area at a coking plant. The extractors were activated manually. The operator activated the internal emergency plan at 16:25. The staff were evacuated. A security perimeter was established. The fuel supply to the installation was shut off. The heating of the batteries was stopped. At 20:00 the fire was extinguished by inerting with nitrogen. The weakened structure was at risk of collapse. At 20:30 the upstream and downstream valves on the detarrer and H2S scrubber were closed, coke oven gas was restored, nitrogen was injected into the gas collector and the structure was assessed. The operator installed solid joints on flanges to isolate the detarrers and the H2S scrubber.
According to the operator, no hazardous or polluting material was released into the atmosphere apart from the (limited) smoke from the fire. The operator estimates the maximum amount of material that reacted in the explosion of the detarrer at 170 kg TNT equivalent. Crude coke gas from coal distillation was burnt in the bleeders (flares above oven batteries) for almost 5 days, which was the time it took to return to service the gas treatment (the detarrer that was destroyed and the H2S scrubber were isolated from the coke gas treatment system and remained out of service for several months). The estimated volume of coke oven gas sent to the bleeders is 3,776,600 Nm³.
Coke gas was then flared for 90 days until the detarrer was replaced.
In total, the operator estimates that 36,790 t of coke oven gas was released and burned via the bleeders and then the flares. A health impact assessment was carried out and the SO2 emissions were modelled – according to the operator this is the only pollutant from combustion that could affect the public. The operator concludes that neither the daily average limit value for the protection of human health, the information and recommendation threshold nor the alert threshold were exceeded.
Following the incident, the damage to outlet valves and pipes was analysed. The work to rebuild the detarrer lasted several months. The material losses are estimated at EUR 10 million and production losses at EUR 9 million.
A 25 mm hole and a crack had been detected on the steam circuit 8 months before the accident which could not be repaired without stopping the detarrer. As monitoring of the oxygen level at the detarrer outlet did not show any anomalies, the repair was scheduled for the routine shutdown 3 days after the day of the accident.
There are several hypotheses as to the origin of the ignition energy: electrostatic due to friction of the air/gas mixture (also comprising dust) on metal plates, chemical due to the presence of pyrophoric material, or mechanical due to a piece of metal falling inside the detarrer. The external expert assessment concluded that the most likely hypothesis was contact between the coke oven gas and oxygen from the air coming from the leak in the steam network and ignition by electrostatic energy generated by friction between the gases and the metal walls.
An electrostatic detarrer had already exploded at this site in July 2005 and at other sites of the group abroad in November 2017 and in 2019. The explosions always occurred when the detarrer was put back into service by supplying the electric fields but never during washing and draining, when the electric fields are not supplied (no ignition source). There were therefore no lessons learned and the risk had not been identified by the operator.

1259,Near Miss,Chemical installations ,"The pressure monitor directly connected to the HF3 daily-supply tank detected increased pressure for four seconds and sounded an alarm as a result.When the alarm goes off, the circulation line’s feed valve to the HF3 daily-supply tank closes automatically.The plant employees concluded that this brief peak in pressure was an incorrect measurement and consequently paid no further attention to it. The employees did not notice that the feed line had closed. In the process control system, the valve closing is displayed both as an alarm activation and in the associated PID.
Because the drainage pump attached to the daily-supply pump continued to operate, it drained liquid HF out of the HF3 daily-supply tank via the pipeline that was open for purposes of outgassing, in the opposite direction to the usual direction of flow, and into the HF2 production plant.Then, during the ‘condensation’ process step, two holding tanks (V1 and V2) in the HF2 production plant were filled with liquid HF from the HF3 daily-supply tank. Before the two holding tanks were unintentionally filled, they were filled to a level of 24% (equivalent to 800 kg of HF 100).Very soon, the level indication there warned that the maximum permitted fill level had been reached (100%, equivalent to 3,400 kg).
At first the plant employees suspected that there had been internal corrosion damage in the cooling system, as a result of which large amounts of cooling brine had ended up in the interior of the condensation tank. The exothermic reaction expected in such a situation did not happen, which puzzled the employees.
Then the employees took additional measures to lower the critical fill level. In addition, they tried unsuccessfully to start one of the condensation tank’s priming pumps. A second priming pump had already been removed for repair.After this, all inflows into the condensation process step were closed. After a short time, liquid HF overflowed from an inspection opening on top of the V2 holding tank.

1260,Near Miss,Petrochemical / Oil Refineries,"On 23 August 2020, as a result of an operating error during an inspection of a faulty air compressor monitor at the catalytic cracking (FCC) plant, the FCC plant had a brief outage.On restarting the FCC plant on 24 August 2020, strong acid water containing hydrocarbons was introduced into the deodoriser via the plant’s cracked petroleum collector. The resulting stable emulsion was no longer separated out in the deodoriser’s inflow reservoir.Consequently, hydrocarbons flowed into the deodoriser.In the FCC area of the plant, the employees present judged the inflow of hydrocarbons into the deodoriser as tolerable, as they believed that the acid water from the plant’s cracked petroleum collector would be immediately separated into a different tank and therefore would be harmless to the deodoriser.However, the separation into a different tank takes place after the deodoriser’s inflow reservoir. The employees in the FCC area of the plant were unaware of this.
Under normal operations, acid water is cleaned in the deodoriser first via an H2S stripper and then via an ammonia (NH3) stripper.The stripped components from the H2S stripper, together with the H2S from the gas processing plant’s amine regenerators, are sent to the Claus plant via the diethanolamine gas separator; the stripped components from the NH3 stripper are sent to the Claus plant via the deodoriser gas separator.Because of the inflow of hydrocarbons into the deodoriser, both the H2S and the NH2 rich gases contained hydrocarbons, which were introduced into the Claus plant.
The introduction of hydrocarbons into the Claus plant triggered several effects. First of all, the Claus plant’s air consumption regulators began to run irregularly and the temperature in the downstream afterburner oven (KTI furnace) increased to the point of alerting the KTI furnace’s high-temperature switch-off (PCT protective device). In the context of the PCT protective device being alerted, the Claus plant’s tail gas was diverted around the KTI furnace via a bypass directly to the chimney. As a follow-up measure, the flow of NH3 rich gas was additionally sent to the H2S flare and burned there in order to stabilise the Claus plant and prevent a complete failure. In total, the Claus plant’s KTI furnace was out of service for a period of 9.5 hours.
The H2S emitted through the chimney during this period led to neighbourhood enquiries from various locations to the north and north-east of the refinery, at distances of between approximately 5 and 20 km.
Safety measures:Alerting the PCT protective device (here: high-temperature switch-off), so that the Claus plant’s tail gas was diverted via a bypass around the KTI furnace directly to the chimney.In order to stabilise the Claus plant and prevent a complete failure, the NH3 rich gas from the deodoriser was sent to the H2S flare system and burned via the flare stack of the elevated flare. The Claus plant was never completely out of service at any point. Reducing or shutting down other upstream refinery plants is too slow to be able to efficiently prevent potential further escalation in a short time.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,gas/vapour/mist/etc release to air,,,,,,,,,00. NAMED SUBSTANCE,"The FCC plant’s air compressor is monitored by various means, including a rotation speed shut-off. On 23 August 2020, one of the three rotation speed monitors broke down and was intended to be repaired that same day. For this, it is necessary to unlock the heavy oil component (HCO) and the catalytic cracked petroleum and gas oil component (LCO) shut-off channels of the rotation speed monitors.The HCO channels were unlocked while the LCO channels were overlooked.The failure to unlock these LCO channels caused the later outage of the FCC plant.
Prior to the start of the repair, the associated documents were examined. The associated operating diagrams concern plans for old AutoCAD (ACAD) applications which were drawn up after the air compressor was put into operation. Unlike what is common nowadays, in earlier times three sheets were used to depict these complex measuring circuits. In addition, the associated access switches are not depicted in the operating diagrams.The access switches can only be inferred from the circuit diagrams of the locking cabinet.A clear and simple depiction of the air compressor’s locks and associated access switches can be found in the associated functional matrix. However, this was not used as a source of knowledge during preparations for repairs.The air compressor’s locks are currently implemented in a wire-programmable control system. As compared to a memory-programmable control system, which is used nowadays to implement such locks, a clear overview of the locks is not shown in a wire-programmable control system.In a memory-programmable control system, the existing switch-offs per signal are clearly and unambiguously depicted.Therefore, it is less likely to overlook switch-off signals and access switches in a memory-programmable control system than in a wire-programmable control system. A detailed inspection of the program logic did not take place. Even in the case of this error pattern, this inspection would not have been necessary if the functional matrices had been used instead.On the basis of previous operational experience, an odour nuisance coming from the chimney during a bypass operation of the KTI furnace had never been observed in the past.On the day of the incident, the employees were acting on false assumptions with regard to the diversion of FCC acid water to the tank prior to the deodoriser. Essentially, the risk of significant consequences resulting from the addition of hydrocarbons to the deodoriser after a brief outage of the FCC plant was underestimated.The deodoriser inflow reservoir is neither designed nor suitable for separating the hydrocarbon phase from the water phase in the case of excessive inflow of hydrocarbons, especially when stable emulsions are introduced into the deodoriser inflow reservoir. Separation is only possible during significantly longer retention times.
In addition to the human errors described above, there were also process-related/technical causes (as described).",,operator error,design of plant/equipment/system,,,"Causes - Human
Causes - Organisational","Depicting and describing the concrete switch-off signals (jumper switches) on the printed form, as well as raising employee awareness of the topic of bypasses.This particularly means that when unlocking switch-off signals, the entire functionality must be carefully reviewed using the existing documentation (operating diagrams, circuit diagrams and, if available, the functional matrix), and all necessary functions must be unlocked.Updating the old ACAD operating diagrams for complex locks (those with more than two switch-off functions, with multiple thresholds resulting in various jumper switches) to have a more modern format and depicting the associated access switches in the operating diagrams.Drawing up a special operating plan as the standard operating plan for each FCC start-up. It will contain how to minimise acid water levels when starting the FCC plant and deodoriser during combination stripper operations. This operating plan will make it possible to separate the stripper waste gas during hydrocarbon inflow and burn it via the H2S flare. This will avoid negative effects on the Claus plant.
The incident clearly shows that overlooking a small measure during maintenance inspections can have significant effects and delayed reactions.The release of hydrogen sulphide did not result in any risk to the public."
