    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Level III chemical alarm issued at 7.56 am due to release of
chlorine beyond the SPOLANA plant, inhabitants of surroundings advised
to evacuate.Activity of the emergency services during the event is described in the description of the course of the accident Discussion with the regional fire council and the inspectorate of the Czech Ministry of Interior.Measures were taken on production operations downstream of the leak (LAO, EVH, KL) in conformity with the emergency plan, therefore it was not necessary to close down operational facilities. Measurements of chlorine concentrations in the atmosphere in effected areas of Spolana were taken by the fire services (8:45 LAO operation - 0.5 ppm, 8:55 Labe dock- 3 ppm). Measurements in the surroundings of the company were performed by EBS Spolana using a monitoring vehicle between 8:20 and 18:05. Measured concentrations of chlorine peaked at 0,6 mg/m3 (0.2 ppm). NES-OkU Melník also performed measurements in the surrounding towns between 9:25 and 11:40. The highest concentrations measured were 0.1 ppm.In an attempt to limit the release of chlorine to the surroundings of building E 4990, the fire services installed water screens and used stable hasicí zarízení on the LAO plant. At 10:16 it was discovered that a brown liquid was flowing from the outflow of channel K1 to the River Labe. The fire services installed a scumboard wall. Visual control, analysis of samples and the short-term staining of the water confirmed that a large flow of water from the water screen had rinsed the sewerage system.In order for the volume of leaking chlorine to be reduced Mr. Juris, after discussion with Mr. Fajkus and Mr. Kubista at around 9:00, decided to transfer the remaining content of tank 8 to tank 9 using the pressure of the chlorine. This however did not reduce the intensity of the chlorine leak. After approx. 60 min. the operation was stopped because the pressure in both of the tanks was presumed to be the same meaning extrusion would not continue. After 11:00 they attempted to limit the leakage by reverse air pressure to the delivery pipe of the pump and resulting back-pressure reduce the level of liquid chlorine in the delivery pipe, whereby improving the conditions under which the fire services were working to seal the leak. This was also to no avail.The activity of the fire services in building E 4990 was performed under extremely difficult circumstances (no light, whole storage area inundated in chlorine, liquid chlorine was spraying from the area of supposed leakage, freezing up of the lid). Contact with the chlorine caused damage to the protective clothing and gloves. It was necessary to regularly substitute fire services members in very short time intervals. Reinforcements were drafted from Melník, Neratovic and Kralup n/V. At 9:14 chlorine began to flow from the pipe in building E 4890, the fire services blocked the pipe at 9:38. The activity of the fire services inside building E 4990 on tank 8 was focused on plugging the supposed source of the leak using lead tape and quick-drying cement. Each attempt to stop the leak was unsuccessful until the pressure in the tank decreased at around 16:00, and it was discovered that the chlorine was leaking from the detached safety pipe of the feed conductor of the pump motor. The fire services finally stopped the leak by plugging the orifice of the detached safety pipe with a wooden peg, just before 17:00.At 17:05 the third degree chemical alarm was withdrawn at Spolana, subsequently NES-OkU Melník informed the residents in the surrounding towns. At 18:02 the second degree chemical alarm at the company was withdrawn.During the accident and after stopping the leak several management meetings took place to plan the necessary and immediate measures to be taken for stopping the leak and restocking of auxiliary agents. Were decided and specified further methods and activities for the decontamination of building E 4990 and tank (securing the tank for removal of the residual chlorine, provision of chlorine cisterns, methods of inspection and control in object E 4990 and its surroundings). Immediate measures were put into place - until the cause of the accident in investigated the remaining liquid chlorine pumps must not be used in the storage area.Information on the accident was relayed to the media by the company's press officer.26.7.2000 all the liquid chlorine was transferred from all of the tanks in building E4990 to the cistern. Decontamination of building E 4990, allowing entry to the building without the need for breathing apparatus was completed on 31.7.2000.On 1.8.2000 the police department performed an inspection of the site in the presence of members of the company's investigative committee. A preliminary enquiry and photo documentation was taken at the site.Decontamination of tank 8 was completed 8.8.2000. An internal inspection of the tank was performed and the pump was removed for inspection.Disassembly of the pump was performed and photo documentation was taken by the firm Neraservis in the presence of members of the committee on 9.8.2000.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Following the explosion, the existing site major emergency plan was immediately triggered. After the explosion, the remaining furnace contents were still 'active', and generating large quantities of blast furnace gas comprising mainly carbon monoxide. Within a short time of the event, blast furnace personnel had established a large water seal at the gas system to isolate the furnace from the downstream gas systems. The water supply from the Energy Department was isolated. The furnace was vented through its flare stack and bleeder valves.The on-site and off-site emergency plans were initiated, and Fire, Police and Ambulance services soon had a strong presence on site.The furnace area was cordoned off by the Police to limit access.Control centres were set up at the scene and at Port Talbot Police Station.Local government facilities were used to keep relatives and members of the public informed.Overall emergency response was acceptable, and an early review of the emergency response has generated improvement plans.The structural stability of the furnace and its associated plant was a matter&amp;nbsp;of immediate concern. Following engineering inspection, remedial works were put in hand to ensure stability and safety.The furnace was largely sealed in preparation for 'quenching'. This involved the carefully controlled addition of thousands of tonnes of water to the furnace contents over a period of weeks&amp;nbsp;to halt the internal reactions, stop gas generation, and put the furnace into a safe condition for demolition. Once necessary forensic examinations had been completed, the 'quenched' burden and the refractory materials within the furnace body were removed. The furnace shell was cut into sections and dismantled. The lower bosh and hearth material was essentially solidified and was not finally removed until most of the furnace structure had been dismantled.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The investigation identified a number of learning points for the company and its blast furnace operations, the wider steel industry, and other manufacturers. These have been communicated to the company and action has followed to make the necessary improvements. Safety managementLesson 1 The company should review the role and function of the Safety Department. It should be better integrated into operational and engineering management.Lesson 2 Blast furnaces are now under the COMAH regime (Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999), where identification and evaluation of major hazards is a legal requirement. Before this, predictive tools and techniques have had relatively limited use within the steel industry. Predictive tools for the assessment and management of risk should receive greater use within the steel industry and other process industries: eg Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOPS), Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Process Hazard Review (PHR) and Layers of Protection Analysis (LoPA).Cooling waterLesson 3 Sufficient cooling water for furnaces should be available at all times; the supply systems should have an adequate level of reliability built into the system. This reliability should be brought about by good engineering design (including an adequate level of redundancy) and suitable maintenance, and should be monitored to indicate any threats to its integrity.Lesson 4 Reliability engineering techniques should be employed to identify safety-critical plant and appropriate safeguards should be developed from these studies.Lesson 5 Closed systems for furnace cooling water, or systems with equal or better reliability, should be provided wherever reasonably practicable.Leak detectionLesson 6 Speed in locating furnace cooling water leaks is essential. Rapid leak detection relies on good engineering, adequate detection protocols and suitably trained and competent operators. All operators of water-cooled furnaces should ensure that there are adequate measures in place for prompt leak detection.Lesson 7 On water-cooled metallurgical furnaces, where it is reasonably practicable, appropriate instrumentation, specifically designed for leak identification, should be installed to give earlier and more precise detection of leaking cooler elements.MaintenanceLesson 8 Maintenance, inspection and, where appropriate, testing of plant and equipment associated with the reliable delivery of water to furnaces should be paramount. The potential effects of lack of maintenance, inspection and testing in terms of safety should be clearly understood. There should be adequate prior communication between works departments when any maintenance or other work that may potentially affect safe plant operation or reliability is proposed. Formal protocols should be considered for this. Safety-critical items should be identified and protocols and priorities established for their maintenance, inspection and testing.Blast furnace recovery and abnormal plant conditionsLesson 9 The specific process of conducting a blast furnace recovery gives rise to additional risks significantly over and above normal operational risks. It is essential that all personnel involved are aware of those risks and there are control measures in place, including arrangements for effective communication,&amp;nbsp;such that adequate risk control is maintained.Lesson 10 A specific issue with the recovery of the&amp;nbsp;blast furnace was that as it developed, there was an incomplete knowledge of the changing status of the furnace. During abnormal plant conditions there should be a competent senior manager detailed to retain an ‘overview’ of the developing situation and to keep a specific watching brief on critical parameters, so as to be able to inform those more intimately involved in dealing with the abnormal situation. Specific parameters in the case of blast furnace recovery operations should include such critical data as liquid iron levels, hydrogen levels and trends.Management of changeLesson 11 A formal system of pre-modification risk assessments should be instituted for any changes (including changes to operating parameters) proposed to safety-related plant and equipment. This should be coupled with post-modification safety reviews. The management of change system should include evaluation and assessment not only by the engineering and operational functions, but also by appropriately experienced and competent safety professionals. Duties and responsibilities for this should be clearly identified. Changes to the physical characteristics of plant should be carefully assessed for any impact on risk profiles and should be carried out with best engineering practice. All such changes should be carefully recorded and subsequently re-evaluated to determine their actual operational impact.Decision makingLesson 12 In emergency situations, there should be management arrangements such that there is a clear ‘line of responsibility’ for decision making. There should be no doubt whatsoever as to who is making which decisions.Lesson 13 Decisions made by managers under pressure from adverse plant or process conditions present a potential source of significant error. Adequate training and experience is essential, but more precise decision-making protocols should be available for foreseeable circumstances to guide and inform decision making. Careful consideration should be given to providing emergency event simulation training etc to build operator confidence and skills in emergency or abnormal process conditions.Design issuesLesson 14 Opportunities to achieve risk reductions by radical design improvements on blast furnaces are very infrequent. The design of new or extensively rebuilt furnaces should take into account the need to improve the reliability of cooling water supplies and to have suitable pipework layout, valve arrangements and water monitoring systems so as to facilitate prompt leak detection and remedial action.Lesson 15 The provision of improved monitoring systems, purpose-built for monitoring cooling water parameters on blast furnaces, should be considered. Safety-specific instrumentation of adequate precision should be designed and installed to address specific foreseeable operational and abnormal operating conditions.Human factorsLesson 16 It is essential during abnormal plant or process conditions that all personnel are clear as to who is responsible for decision making and that they have provided adequate lines of communication. Employees should have a precise and clear view of their roles and responsibilities, and be supported by suitable training, procedures and other job aids.Lesson 17 The awareness of the danger of water/metal and water/slag explosions should be raised among all employees engaged in processes where this is a risk. The degree of risk presented by molten materials coming into contact with water continues to be not fully appreciated.Lesson 18 The process risks associated with safety-critical plant, especially ageing plant, should be thoroughly understood through rigorous assessment processes, with these being subject to regular review. Specifically, with water systems on blast furnaces, a ‘leakage tolerant’ attitude should not be allowed,&amp;nbsp;especially with older furnaces. Such raised acceptance of water leaks increases the risks of an adverse event occurring at some point.For more details, See the full report on the incident&amp;nbsp;- http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web34.pdf&amp;nbsp;</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

A search team was asked to locate the gas oil released into the ground. It arrived at about 10:10 and immediately checked the groundwater monitoring stations located in this area. An excavator was ordered for the excavation work, or to dig trenches in order to locate the released gas oil and extract it immediately with a vacuum truck provided by the disposal firm.
The excavator arrived at about 10:30 and immediately began excavating the soil and transferring it into the skips provided. The filled skips were covered with weatherproof tarpaulins. Another outside firm made two boreholes with a diameter of 800 mm and a depth of 8 metres in the damage zone. 300 mm diameter pipes were inserted into these boreholes in order to extract the released oil from the subsoil by suction. Oil that had already collected in the borehole was immediately extracted by the vacuum truck on the spot.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Change the procedure for using mobile pumps.
-	Technical measures: use non return valves and flange connections instead of tank wagon couplings, including for hosepipes.
-	Organisational measures: mobile pumps to be used only on impervious subsoil and/or with permanent monitoring by a 'hosepipe watch' on the spot. The Baden-Württemberg Agency for the Environment, Measurements and Nature Conservation would like to draw attention in particular to the following points and findings:
1.	Hose couplings are detachable connections. They are used in a number of standards in the petroleum industry and the chemical industry for temporary pumping operations and are widespread.
2.	Making a connection requires knowledge of how to operate the coupling system and its particular features. Employees must be given appropriate training for this.
3.	Particularly in the case of use in the open, and therefore including in inclement weather conditions, there may be interference or risk involved in making the connection due to rain, snow, ice, contamination, foreign bodies, etc.
4.	Hoses and couplings must be checked for damage and/or wear and regularly tested.
5.	Visual leakage checks, usually carried out at the start of a pumping operation, give no guarantee that couplings will stay leaktight throughout the process.
6.	If a coupling does fail, considerable quantities of liquid will be released via both cross sections ('male' and 'female' parts) in a short space of time.
7.	Measures which will detect the failure of a hose coupling immediately are to be recommended. One solution is to have permanent monitoring by a 'hosepipe watch'.
8.	For safety reasons, correctly assembled flange connections are technically preferable to hose couplings.
9.	Non return valves can limit the amount of liquid released in the event of failure.
10.	Mobile pumps should be used only on an impervious subsoil.
11.	Wherever possible, rigid piping should be used for transfer pumping operations.
12. Transfer pumping operations must undergo a systematic risk analysis. In the medium term: make and install stationary residue systems for the tank farm.

Dismantling of the deformed toluene tank and the severely damaged equipment, repairing the damage to adjacent tanks, repairs to the tank retention pond and the pipe trench, settlement of recognised claims for damage caused by soot (black carbon) pollution.
Blocking off and emptying the damaged tank, extraction and disposal of the used water in accordance with a corresponding declaration analysis, tests on the impermeability of the tank retention pond.
Warning local residents using sirens and radio announcements, support for the plant fire service in fighting the fire, a special operation by the LANUV to take swipe samples around the city of Cologne and laboratory analysis of the samples.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
The labelling of all extinguishing equipment on site was checked. No more incorrect labels were found. In the regular annual checks on the fire protection equipment on tanks, labels and pipe layout will also be checked.
The deficiencies identified in checks on the adjacent tanks were rectified promptly. The damaged toluene tank was dismantled and the tank retention pond was cleaned. The cleaning measures recommended by the geotechnical engineer were carried out.
The manufacturer of the semi-subsurface extinguishing system was informed that, in plants with similar storage conditions and similar substances, incorrect deployment of the fire extinguishing equipment could produce an ignition source.
The manufacturer is currently testing the possibility of replacing the existing hose with one made out of a conductive material. Until the outcome is known, organisational measures will be taken at the plant to ensure that the fire extinguishing equipment is not set off by accident (checks on labelling, cable fuses on the final valves on the tank).
If it proves possible to substitute the hose material and if tests confirm the material’s suitability, technical documentation can be drawn up to provide proof of suitability and enable the purchase of new and replacement parts.
The layout of the semi-subsurface fire extinguishing equipment in the toluene tank was examined by an expert and clearly presented. The examination did not reveal any work that was required.. The ignition sources analysis for the tank farm affected by the fire will be reviewed. Generally applicable points will be incorporated into an overarching explosion protection document, which will be finalised by the end of 2015.


The testing basis, scope and intervals and the format of the test reports for the equipment in each department are laid down using the findings from the ignition source analysis. Furthermore, the instructions for testing staff (those authorised to carry out tests, authorised experts, etc.) will be laid down and links will be created to quickly locate testing documents.

With regard to public safety, a D3 announcement will be made at an early stage for future incidents with a comparable external impact.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A pool fire (fire of the retention basin)&amp;nbsp; is avoided by pouring out emulsifiers. The neighbouring tanks are cooled with water sprays. The fire is declared extinguished around 19:45.The different tanks are sprinkled (sprayed down) until 23:00, when the fire department ends the emergency response operations. The quantity of emulsifiers stocked on the site (23,000 l) is sufficient to extinguish the fire. The water used for fire fighting is collected in the retention ponds.The extinguishing water supply was restored during the same evening by pumping water from the river which flows at a distance of about 500 m from the site. New emulsifiers were ordered.Being a classified hazardous installation, the Distillery and Sugar Factory was subject to the ministerial decree of 28 January 1993 on the protection against lightning of certain installations classified in relation to environmental protection (an obligation which was included also in the governor's order concerning the site).This ministerial decree states in Article 2 that the lightning protection devices must comply with the French norm C 17-100, while in Article 6 a time limit of 6 years is granted for the modification of existing equipment in order to comply with the norm.The circular letter No. 93-17 of 28 January 1993 on the application of the ministerial decree requires the plant operator to provide a preliminary lightning protection report.The operator submitted this study on 9 December 1998. The recommendations included the installation of fire arrestors on the vents and breather valves for the various alcohol storage tanks.These fire arrestors had not been installed. The inspectorate of classified installations recorded the facts. In addition, an order was issued on 10th August giving the operator notice to install these devices within one month.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In May of the same year, the operators had carried out an Internal Emergency Plan training, based on the scenario of a fire involving one of the alcohol tanks. Therefore, the emergency services knew the site well, and the emergency equipment was set up quickly, in the context of a smoothly working emergency response system.The way in which the emergency response operations were carried out did not cause any particular remarks by the inspectorate.Direct protection devices against lightning (lightning conductors) were installed, but perhaps the wiring system designed for carrying the currents originating from atmospheric discharges (equipotential bonding between different tanks and the earthing points), located in determined positions to protect specific areas against lightning hazards, were inadequate.Also the absence of flame arrestors has contributed to setting off the explosion.According to the evidence collected, it appears that another lightning struck a few moments before near to an electricity tower. The energy conducted to earth has certainly caused changes in the soil characteristics near the storage site.In conclusion, it must be remarked that&amp;nbsp; 23,000 litres of&amp;nbsp; emulsifiers and 7000 m3 of water were used during this accident.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

At the same time, the drained hydrogen peroxide was diluted with water, and the vapours were abated. In addition, the tank was externally cooled with water.
Because of the risks for the emergency response team, the drainage had to be stopped. As a preventive measure, the population was alerted.
</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A short time after the tank burst, another tank had been contaminated over a pressure bouncing pipe.
The main part of the contaminated tank content was drained and allowed to decompose. A small part was immediately processed. The tank was washed and put out of service
Another damaged tank was drained, cleaned and put out of service.
The ventilation pipe of the closed circuit line was modified to avoid the suction of process solution, before setting the ring line into service again.
The pipe has been set out of service meanwhile, to avoid any contamination by dusty air.
Local temperature indicators are replaced by remote indicators, releasing the alarm automatically when a fixed temperature gradient is exceeded.
Moreover, measurement data are recorded.
New tanks to be installed, will be equipped with a pressure relief system (folding roof).

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The firefighters used water curtains to protect adjacent units. At around 5.45 p.m., shift leader 1 consulted the shift leader of the adjacent unit. They suspected a leak in the ethylene supply network. Two operators with noise protection equipment went into the cloud, protected by a water curtain, so as to reach the network’s manual cut-off valves. They shut them manually, stopping the leak. The cloud quickly dispersed. The staff returned to the control room and shut the local valve feeding the compressor.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Information that would have made it possible to rapidly identify the equipment in which the leak originated was not taken advantage of because there was no-one in the control room and the information was not relayed to the mobile phones of the shift members who had gone to investigate or made their way to the other control rooms in the complex.
If the emergency shut-down had been activated, the leak would have been stopped earlier as such a shut-down cuts off both the motor and the ethylene supply. The staff thought it was enough that the motor had shut down as a safety measure when the vibration occurred. After the accident, the compressor was fitted with a system for emergency shut-down when gas is detected. However, manual emergency shut-down is still crucial in the event that the gas detection fails.
Despite the risks of the cloud igniting (UVCE, flash fire), the internal emergency plan was not launched, staff were not evacuated and movements on the site were not restricted.&amp;nbsp; The emergency services and nearby municipalities were not alerted. At the time, the head of the safety team deemed the situation to be under control because it was not windy and there were no sub‑contractor firms on site that day, a Saturday (no works, low vehicle traffic). The authorities were notified more than 24 hours later. The external alert procedures were reviewed.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">ON SITEAccordino to environmental monitoring system equipped with VCM detectors (annex 4) at 7.51.38 sensor Nr. 30,positioned near reactors 7 and 8 detected the presence of VCM, indicating a value of &amp;gt; 100 ppm (upper measurement limit). It is observed that detector Nr. 36, located a few m from the release point did not detect any VCM at 7.50.17, it is concluded therefore that the CSM release occurred between 7.50.17 hrs and 7.51.38 hrs.Analysing the data provided by the plant operator concerning the VCM detectors and the data obtained from the Distributed Control System (DCS), like the data registered by detector FI900 (mass flow meter) or PI906 ( pressure sensor of feeding line B) there is a discrepancy with the indicated timing.The operator declared (pag 5 annex 5) that the time indicated in the DCS is always 7 minutes and 29 seconds later than the time indicated by the sensors.The shift assistant was informed immediately over the phone by the personnel in the control room, that the sensor system indicated the presence of VCM onsite, he came directly into the control room. Also the operative assistant came into the control room, after he was informed via intercommunication system and had ordered the entire personnel to go to the emergency gathering points foreseen by the onsite emergency response plan.The external reactor assistant, equipped with self-respirator and a portable VCM-meter went to check the detector which triggered alarm. Successively also the shift assistant went to the release area equipped with self-respirator and reached the filter P24123/B almost contemporarily with the external assistant, there they both noticed that the filter was releasing two phase VCM from the flanged coupling in correspondence of the filter cap.According to the reconstruction made by the operator the timing was the following:7.52 signal from the mass spectrometer7.54reactor assistants goes to the release point7.55 the shift foreman goes to the release point7.58 Closure of the manual valve upstream of the filter7.58 Closure of the valve downstream of the filter8.00&amp;nbsp; Start of gas relief operation8.03 shut off operation of the valve downstream of the filter completed and connection of the filter with the gas relief line and pressure relief.8.04 Alerting of the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole.The company alerted the Operative Centre for Emergency Response of the industrial pole (pag. 7 annex 5) by dialling 3333, requesting the assistance of an emergency response team to set up water curtains in order to avoid the dispersion of VCM and to abate the VCM in the area affected by the release. Afterwards the shift technician informed the fire department in Porto Marghera about the event and informed via FAX the authorities, on the starting and ending time of the emergency, as foreseen by the communication procedure of the company.The operator ordered, consequent to the event, all department personnel not involved in the emergency response to reach the gathering points, as foreseen by the on-site emergency response plan. At 9.15 hrs the operator called off the emergency and normal vehicle circulation conditions around the department and the access to the department were re-established.OFF SITEThe accident did not trigger the offsite emergency response plan, nor the alarm sirens placed on acoustic poles in the city of Marghera were activated to alert the population.Emergency measures - Remarks: At 8.04 hrs INEOS requested the intervention of the Operative Emergency Response Centre of the chemical pole. The emergency alert was passed to the fire brigade of the pole located 300-400 m from the accident place. the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera intervened and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains. They installed the water curtains using the water distribution system of the department and specific equipment they brought. The shift technician of SPM (Servizi Porto Marghera) called the security service of the chemical pole, in accordance with the emergency response procedures of the establishment, to control the vehicle movement inside the establishment and the access to the establishment itself, the shift technician also activated the message transmission system of the Site Integrated Emergency Management System.The Integrated Emergency Management System of the Site sent three messages concerning the evolution of the event.Time of the message8.17 PIE team in CV24 to check VCM release from the coupled flange of filter to reactors8.18 CV24: release stopped, circuit aspiring, teams assisting8.34 CV24: event ended, plant in safe conditionThe alarm in the department does not represent an emergency situation for the Integrated Emergency Management System.In the report of INEOS dated 12/07/2006 (annex 5) it is stated that, apart from isolating the leaking filter the personnel responding to the emergency took the necessary measures to transfer the VCM from the filter to the abatement system.During the operation the technicians detected the persistence of the release from the failed filter gasket, due to an incomplete emptying of the filter itself. They substituted the failed gasket at 9.40 to assure the complete safety of the area affected.Official action taken - legal action:&amp;nbsp;a)legal action
The competent Attorney General's Office of Venice opened a proceeding to evaluate the responsibility of the company with regards to the accident.
Following a joint inspection of ARPA Venice and the public fire department of Venice (annex 14) a preliminary report has been issued.

Official action taken - other official action: b) other official action
The Occupational Health and Safety Service of the Local Socio Sanitary Unit NR. 12 (Venice) prescribed according to art 20 of legislative decree 758/94 following measures to limit the consequences of similar accidents.
The Occupational Health and Safety Service prescribed refurbishment and improvement measures for the pressurisation and conditioning system of the control room of plant CV24/25, and the installation of adequate sanitary services apt to be used in case of accidental exposition to VCM of a worker.

Discussion about response: Concerning the notification of the accident to the European Commission  according to paragraph I.1 of Anex VI of legislative decree 334/99:
The occurrence has to be notified to the Commission as accidental release, if the assumption that 4000 kg of VCM were effectively released as measured by the flow-meter is considered credible; as the quantity corresponds to more than 5% of the threshold quantity for extremely flammable substances which is fixed for the application of art. 8 b - legislative decree 334/99 in 50 tons.

The company used a generic procedure for the substitution of PTFE gaskets on RF type flanges (annex 13).** The company has performed an investigation on accidents, near misses and non conformities (registration Nr. 120/06) in the context of the Safety Management System, the report states that the fundamental elements of the SGS in play during an emergency are the operative control and the emergency planning.*** The emergency response procedure in case of VCM release foresees the remote shut off of the root valves. It is pointed out that the workers have closed the remote control root valves once they closed manually the isolating valves of the filter which was not foreseen by the emergency response procedure.Concerning the compliance with art 21 of legislative Decree 334/99 with respect to the Safety Report and to art. 25 of legislative Decree 334/99 with respect to the SMS assessment, the approval procedure of the safety Report presented in 2000 had been concluded while the approval process of the safety Report presented in 200 is still undergoing.The last assessment of the SMS made with the commission named by the Environmental ministry was concluded in 2002.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence:&amp;nbsp; a) measures to prevent recurrenceThe company declared that (annex 2):- the accident was caused by the failure of the sealing gasket of the cap of filter P24123/B installed on the reactor feeding line B. Possible causes of the accident:1. defective sealing surfaces (non planar surfaces, dirty surfaces)2. faulty tightening of the bolts after substitution of the candle filters3. failure of the gasket employedDue to the fact that it is not possible to identify one single accident cause it has been decided to take preventive measures concerning all 3 potential accident causes described above:1) refurbishment of all 4 filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C. The operator has provided to grind all gasket seats of the flanges and of the candle filter bearing plate, although the inspection and tests performed on the filter did not show any defects on the sealing surfaces, this operation was performed under the supervision of ARPA Venice.2) The tightening torque for the bolts of the flanged coupling was calculated and a procedure and regulation for the closure of filters P24123/A-B e P24104/B-C was established.3) Modification have been performed on the equipment in order to minimise from the source pressure variations during the VCM charging process of the reactors.4) The emergency response procedures of the department have been revised concerning the response to similar accidents. The personnel of the department has been trained concerning the emergency response and how to isolate the VCM lines in case of VCM release.5 A study on the possibility to install a double sealing system on the filter cover is foreseen.6) Compliance with the measures prescribed by the Occupational Health and Safety ServiceMeasures to mitigate consequences: b) measures to mitigate consequencesAfter the integrated emergency response system of the establishment triggered alarm, the fire brigades of the company Servizi Porto Marghera (SPM) intervened to and took measures for the precautionary containment of the VCM by the means of water curtains. Useful references: The company has presented a technical consultancy report on the impact of the VCM by Doct. Tommaso A. Dragani (annex 12) in which it is stated that the VCM release did not constitute a health hazard.

Because the possibility of mutual interference had not been investigated, the sequence of events resulting in this emission could not have been recognised in advance.
In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Commission’s Major Accident Hazards Bureau (MAHB) has developed a ‘Lessons Learnt Bulletin’:https://minerva.jrc.ec.europa.eu/en/shorturl/minerva/llb_covidv3pdf
In addition, the International Council of Chemical Associations (ICCA) has published a document addressing plant and process safety in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, with the title ‘Be Smart: Safe Restart – Re-Starting Chemical Production Facilities Post COVID-19 Restrictions’:https://www.americanchemistry.com/Be-Smart-Safe-Restart.pdf

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">At the suggestion of the inspectors, the Prefect has issued an urgent order requiring, in particular, the shut down of production, the removal of finished products and the restriction of storage to buildings in an undamaged state.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; shut down of fireworks production, with start up subject to a new authorization procedure;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; removal of the remaining pyrotechnical products from all the manufacturing workshops;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the rehabilitation of two storage buildings, in order to store the company's pyrotechnical products according to the existing regulations, within the authorized threshold limits;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the storage of all on site intermediate products in a third storage building;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the separation of storage facilities&amp;nbsp; between products for sale and intermediate products;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the removal of pyrotechnical products from the other storage buildings;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the maintenance of permanent monitoring and control of the site;-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the disposal of all those intermediate products whose expected behaviour in case of activation has been called into question.Since the accident, the operator has cleared his stocks of finished products on the occasion of the 2004 summer firework display season. The operation of elimination of non-saleable intermediate products was carried out by their disposal in accordance to the specific regulations in an dedicated area onsite.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A this stage of the investigation, lessons learned from the accident are primarily of organisational nature:The best possible risk characterisation of the products (according to the kind of storage or transport), with particular attention given to intermediate products. Since the operators of small installations have difficulty in classifying all their products by means of standardized tests, at the very least, a stricter implementation of existing regulations has to be sought;Compliance with the onsite safety procedures in force in the different areas. Vigilance on this point tends to wane with time and at busy periods;Maintenance of rigorous control of the operation conditions and the amounts of hazardous products presents in the manufacturing and storage units.These basic rules already figure in the French regulations applicable to this activity sector.On the technical level, even if the exact origin of the disaster remains unknown, several aggravating factors have been identified:The bulk storage in crates of the candle bombs, creating thus confinement conditions for these products, undoubtedly contributed in crating detonation conditions;The fact that the stored bombs were primed could have led to their mass ignition by friction. This is because the priming process consists in coating the outer surface of the bombs with a layer of gunpowder for the purpose of ensuring the propagation of the flame from one bomb to the next inside the candles;The proximity of the storage area of these products to the two manufacturing shops tends to introduce a risk of domino effect which may be wrongly evaluated. A surprise inspection operation was launched on 12 establishments in the Aquitaine region 3 weeks after the accident. Administrative and penal sanctions were imposed on 5 establishments, and complementary actions have also been taken towards contractors.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

1) Organized more than 100 workers from Nanniwan Oil Production Plant of Changqing Oilfied (belonging to Yan' an Petroleum Group Corp.) and mobilized machinery and equipment from the plant to dispose of the incident. The rescue workers cut off the power at the incident site, built 3 dams to block the leaked oil within a dry ditch to prevent it from flowing into the Pine River (a Class Two branch of Yellow River; its downstream has drinking water sources) and then recovered the leaked crude oil at the incident site;
2) Shut down the valve of the oil pipeline and blocked the broken pipeline. By 2:40 pm, the leaking pipeline had been blocked. At 5:00 pm, Changqing Oilfield organized workers to weld the broken pipeline. At 10:00 pm, the pipeline resumed its oil delivery function;
3) Mobilized 12 oil tank trucks and other vehicles to recover the leaked crude oil. By 11:00 pm, the leaked oil had been basically all recovered, and the polluted soil was disposed of with landfill and leakproof measures.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Some employees used fire fighting hoses from the on-site fire-fighting equipment against the fire. Within 20 minutes the fire propagated to the 3 units belonging to the operator, via the roof and the existing openings in the walls. The partial collapse of a dividing wall made of breeze blocks allowed&amp;nbsp; the propagation of the fire to crop protection products and to animal foods stock belonging to a logistics company associated to the operator. The smoke affected 37 members of the fire brigade, 7 of whom were hospitalised under observation. The extinguishing water (1,500 m3), contaminated with fertilisers and herbicides, detergents, and soaps, collected in a non-hermetic storm basin, threatening to pollute some drinking water catchments.Requisitioning measures were taken to ensure quick drainage and storage of the contaminated water for later treatment. The fire was put under control about 2 hours after its start. The building was partly preserved due to the means deployed by the emergency response services.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The rapid spread of the fire to a cell occupied by a third party shows that it is important to verify the applicability of construction regulations and adapt them to the specific conditions of the site. The presence of arsenic derivatives in amounts above the thresholds defined in the SEVESO Directive makes the monitoring of the inventory and its risk assessment mandatory.The pollution of the storm drain threatening the water table justifies the need for a hermetic extinguishing water retention pond. Each operator should construct a retention basin or each category of activity should at least have a retention pond at its disposal.In this specific case of a platform operated by different companies, responsibilities were difficult to determine and this caused a significant delay in implementing measures intended for an efficient emergency response.Law suits and administrative recourse have significantly complicated and slowed down the resolution of the pollution problem.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The following measures are the result of an expert opinion issued in accordance with Section 29b of the Federal Immission Control Act. They have been approved by the Düsseldorf Regional Government.
Measure 1:The newly installed ball valve must be included in the zinc sulfate installation’s testing plan. Testing must cover at least the functionality of the measurement and control equipment (position feedback) and the leakproofness and mobility of the ball valve (due to interference from sediments).The testing cycle will initially be set at 1 year.
Measure 2:The ball valve position feedback must be shown in the P&amp;amp;I diagram. Until the next revision of the P&amp;amp;I diagram, a redline revision in the master copy will suffice.
Measure 3:The procedural instructions ‘Production and purification of raw zinc sulfate solution’ must be extended to include a passage describing the procedure for purging a blockage in the pipe from the container to the filter press. It should at least describe how to purge the blockage and what to do if a simple purging does not work. Training must be given on what to do in the event of a fault, and evidence of this training must be documented.
Measure 4:The opening of pipelines containing hazardous substances must be described in separate procedural instructions. Training must be given on this, and evidence of this training must be documented.
Measure 5:The operator must demonstrate that, even if the entire contents of the container is discharged, no other substances stored in the wettable area that have material incompatibilities with the raw material solution (e.g. zinc dust, reactive sludges) make their way into the raw material solution. This proof can be provided by a member of staff with comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter (demonstrated by relevant university studies) by 1 October 2019.
Measure 6:The floor in the raw materials hall is not sufficiently resistant to raw material solutions. The area beneath the pump is not currently visible, as the pump operates in an elevated position. As a high-performance forced conveyor, vibrations in this area cannot be ruled out during the pump’s operation. It is therefore necessary to check whether the floor beneath the pump has been damaged by the incident in such a way that it can no longer be guaranteed with sufficient certainty that the pump is mounted securely.
Measure 7:During the incident, some of the raw material solution was able to flow freely through the rear hall gate into the yard. Following the incident, in order to prevent the yard’s asphalt surface from being contaminated by raw material solution from the container again, the operator added a raised edge, in the form of a threshold, to the floor at the rear gate in order to increase the retention volume of the raw materials hall. The threshold is exposed to mechanical loads due to site traffic (forklift trucks). The threshold must undergo regular visual inspection to check for damage. The proposed interval for these inspections is monthly. This inspection must be included in the zinc sulfate installation’s testing plan.
Measure 8:At the time of the incident, pallets bearing sales goods had been placed in the outdoor area behind the raw materials hall. The raw material solution that ran through the gate was able to enter a drain hidden beneath these pallets unnoticed. After the incident, the operator marked out restricted zones in the areas leading to the drains, into which, due to the gradient leading away from the raw materials hall, leaked raw material solution could run in spite of any and all measures taken. Management must check at least weekly that the designated restricted zones are always kept unobstructed. Staff are to be instructed that the restricted zones must be kept unobstructed. This instruction is to be documented.
Measure 9:The plant drainage plan must be revised. The drains running from the inlets in the yard behind the raw materials hall to the six-chamber tank at the SO2 installation must be recorded and shown.

The first fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation. The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated.The cooling of the tanks was carried out by means of 25 guns employing about 2000 m3/h over 24 hours. The extinguishing of the fire was carried out, during the first attempt, with 9 guns employing 72,000 litres of foam. During the second attempt were used 17 guns and 140,000 litres of foam. After the fire was extinguished, the cooling of the tanks continued for the following two days, using a limited amount of foam as a preventive measure. On June 6-7, a small quantity of foam was used, as a preventive measure, during the draining of some tanks. Polluted fire fighting water and unburned hydrocarbons that could be contained (about 10,000 m3 remained in the parks and drains) were collected and transferred by barges and wagons to a petroleum refinery for treatment.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the accident occurred, the local authorities were alarmed by telephone and, soon after, a first control center was made up by the fire brigade. The first fire brigade (42 men and 4 fire-trucks) arrived on-site and started the procedures to isolate the storage installation. The traffic road in the area was interrupted and the personnel in the industrial area was evacuated. The Particular Emergency Plan was activated. Fire fighting operations required the intervention of more than 150 firemen for about 24 hours. About 200 policemen were employed to control the road traffic, evacuate the personnel in the industrial area and transport the foam during the night. 25 people (13 of them were doctors) give medical help (18 beds for injured people and 11 operating rooms were prepared).Official action taken - other official action: Cleaning of the plant when the authorities will allow it.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE ACCIDENT:These measures will be defined when the results of the investigations will be available. In any case, a revision of technical regulations for hydrocarbons storage areas was foreseen. The main conclusions were the following:1- fixed-roof tanks without weak seam for roof-to-shell attachment are very dangerous because in case of overpressure (which may occur during a fire) the collapse will happen at their bottom part (hence, the released product can spread around feeding the fire);2- the application of cooling water is not very effective. Use of foam was very effective;3- need for special suitable foams for polar hydrocarbons storage;4- old regulations for storage installations were not adequate;5- concrete dikes do not guarantee resistance for a sufficiently long period of time in case of fire and, hence, earth bund walls are preferable.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The operator, required to find another means to dispose of his effluent, at first distributed them round several urban sewage works. The cost is estimated at more than 300,000 Euros. The operator was required to restore correct operation.

</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It is worth noting that the plan was to construct in 2000 a buffer basin between the physico-chemical treatment and the biological. Such a buffer basin would in this case have avoided the overload and subsequent malfunctioning of the treatment works.
It is important to ensure that environmental factors are taken into account better by the operators of installations like this one, where a small enterprise can produce severe local pollution.
Finally, better communication would have reduced the total amount of pollution, since the measures taken to shut down the installation would have been taken sooner.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: (1) Inadequate records
of maintenance for the steam injectors are kept (inadequate maintenance
documentation).
(2) The precautions against syphoning are rudimentary. There is no
automatic monitoring of the water levels in cup seals (no
automatisation).Measures to prevent recurrence: Modification to the steam injectors and the holder's superstructure to prevent the equipment ability to syphon and to stop steam lines fouling leading either to loss of anti-freeze capability and/or misalignment of injection equipment.Mitigate consequences: The installation of cup-scale monitoring to set an alarm if low water level are identified. The development of appropriate monitoring and review procedures for the business.Useful references: i) BG have an internal computer model for the dispersion of low pressure natural gas from a cup/ grip seal failure.   ii) The Institution of Gas Engineers IGE/SR/4 '' Low pressure Gas Holders Storing Water then Air Cover 2nd Edition.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The accident occurred at around 12 noon. The internal emergency procedures were activated within ten minutes. As there was no fire, some members of the emergency team treated the injured and transferred them to Brindisi hospital in the company ambulance. Other team members searched for the fourth worker who was carrying out the hot work; he was found dead. The pumps to the TKX tank were closed and the unit put in safety mode. A fire brigade team called to the site by people outside the plant arrived 15 minutes after the accident and carried out emergency operations. Half an hour after the accident the emergency medical services arrived, having been called in by the company employees. The medical services confirmed the death of the fourth subcontract worker. Three ambulances were present at the accident site. The fire brigade's special CBRN team also arrived half an hour after the accident in order to check for the possible presence of explosive atmospheres. The emergency was closed within approximately four hours when the emergency services returned to base.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The lack of aeration at the base of the equalisation tanks leads to anaerobic fermentation of accumulated residues with the production of various highly inflammable gases. Highly explosive mixtures can ignite at the slightest opportunity, particularly if hot work is carried out without taking the necessary precautions. Aeration of the tank base is vital for safety reasons and must not be done away with for any reason.
In the ATEX Directive (96/92/EC) plants with tanks containing spent broths are classified as being at risk of the creation of explosive atmospheres, and ATEX and safety procedures must therefore be used.
For modifications, even temporary ones, the risks must be analysed using appropriate methods, such as HAZOP. The risks of such work must also be analysed.
Employees and workers from subcontract firms must be informed about and trained in safety procedures, and more importantly the unit heads must have a culture of safety, i.e. the strict application of safety procedures.
Accidents of this kind may happen in future, also due to the expansion of biotechnology in different sectors. While many biotechnologies are malodorous, this unpleasant aspect cannot be eliminated at the cost of creating much more serious risks, as in this case.

Factors such as operating and maintenance competencies, introduction of new technology (in this case automation of the de-waxing cycle) and human error (unfamiliarity with new equipment). The importance of following prevention procedures relating to control incidents is also reinforced (in this case equipment preparation for maintenance).Further measures:A comprehensive incident investigation was conducted with a representative team comprising a senior engineer, operations supervisor, health and safety representative, project engineer, safety management system coordinator and lead by a trained incident investigation leader. Refresher training was provided to project and surveillance technical support personnel on project changes and documentation requirements. Additional training was provided for personnel operating and maintaining the new prover. The training refreshed aspects of the prover operation and provided additional details for the automatic de-waxing cycle sequencing which is an aspect of the operation not immediately apparent to users of the equipment. Refresher training was provided to technicians on work management practices, including equipment preparation for maintenance, job planning and hazard assessment.
Previous risk assessments were reviewed and found to be appropriate. The project risk assessments had identified the potential for a spill (low likelihood) but took a conservative approach in any event by providing a concrete bund although it was not mandated. The project implementation system was reviewed to ensure provision of training to address secondary components (those not obvious) prior to commissioning equipment. The following company controls worked well:

Basic Technician competencies in operating process equipment when managing the incident response.
Design, risk assessment and controls (layers of protection) for the new prover, which provided for the installation of a bund.
Workforce involvement and consultation during project development and incident investigation.
Incident response, containment and clean-up.
Incident investigation and closeout of recommendations.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The onsite emergency plan has been triggered, initially an extended emergency was declared, and successively an major accident was declared, in compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan.Chronology of the measures adopted:At 16:10 hrs the authorities competent for emergencies were alerted by FAX, in compliance with the common agreement protocol with the local authorities.Approximately at 17:35 hrs, immediately after the insulation dismantling operation had been concluded, the personnel staying uphill to the subway, saw smoke coming from the opposite side off the subway (sea side) some 60 m from the leakage point. At this stage, approximately 3 hours after the leak detection the onsite emergency response plan was triggered: - mobilisation of the onsite fire brigade,&amp;nbsp;- isolation of the pipe lines starting with the leaking one, as precautionary measure,&amp;nbsp;- closing of road ex SS114 passing through the establishment,The onsite fire brigade intervened initially with two vehicles, spraying foam on the area were the smoke was coming from. At 17:42 hrs the shift fire brigade commander alerted the fire department in Siracusa when he understood that the fire was out of control.Meanwhile the shift manager called the refinery's emergency response committee and alerted the personnel of Syndial and Polimeri Europa, owners of some pipe lines in the affected trench.After a few minutes another fire front developed from the entry of the subway in road Nr 9/0 (uphill), also this fire was fought initially by the onsite emergency response services, with other two fire fighting vehicles.At 18:10 hrs The public fire brigade from Siracusa arrived and took command of the emergency response management.At 18:50 a first BLEVE explosion occurred in another pipeline line containing probably light hydro carbons, and was followed by successive explosions of pipelines in the same trench, all due to the overheating of the products inside the pipeline consequent to the heat irradiation of the fire in the trench.At 18:55 the decision was taken to shut down of all installations inside the establishment, as precautionary measure.Fire extinguishing operations lasted 48 hours in all, the accident developed in different successive phases with the fire catching strength, from 3 of May in the morning to 4 of May in the evening. The emergency response operations continued with monitoring and cooling measures of the area affected until the following day, when the prefect declared the end of the emergency.The fire extinguishing operations have been managed in such way to confine the fire in the area corresponding to the subway without extinguishing the fire completely, in order to eliminate completely the presence of hydrocarbons from the hardly accessible trench, where hydrocarbon vapours could have ignited again at any point.Competent Authorities involved (alerted or actively involved in the response)Prefecture of Siracusa, Communal Civil Protection of Priolo and Mellili. Civil Protection of the Sicily Region, Carabinieri, State Police, Attorney General's Office, ARPA Siracusa department.&amp;nbsp;At 18:55 the shut down of all installations inside the establishment was decided as precautionary measure.The Prefect ordered the closure of all gates of the establishment in accordance with the Offsite Emergency Plan, this caused the interruption of all vehicle circulation in the area around the accident place for several days. The circulation on the Siracusa-Catania railway was interrupted during 48 hours, and the ship circulation in the port of Augusta was interrupted during approx. 36 hours.The road exnSS114 was closed during 53 days, waiting for the results of the static structural tests and the substitution of the damaged asphalt covering.The offsite emergency has not caused health consequences to the population living in the neighbouring Communes. The major of Priolo ordered the closure of the public schools for one day&amp;nbsp; and invited the population to stay indoors immediately after the accident as precautionary measure.Emergency measures - Remarks: "Rebuilding" refers to the repair of the subway, the substitution of the pavement, the road signs and the guardrails of ex SS114 damaged by the fire on a approx. 100m long road section.
Official action taken - legal action: The Attorney General's Office of Siracusa has opened a criminal proceeding against some of the refinery's managers, with the objective to determine the causes and the responsibilities related to the accident.  With this objective the Attorney General's office has charged a commission of three experts, who officially delivered and deposited on 16/11/2006 a technical consultancy report, copy of which has also been given to the Commission.
The criminal proceeding is still under way.
TUV Italia  S.r.l. has performed a specific study (report  nThe Attorney General's Office of Siracusa has opened a criminal proceeding against some of the refinery's managers, with the objective to determine the causes and the responsibilities related to the accident.&amp;nbsp; With this objective the Attorney General's office has charged a commission of three experts, who officially delivered and deposited on 16/11/2006 a technical consultancy report, copy of which has also been given to the Commission.The criminal proceeding is still under way.TUV Italia&amp;nbsp; S.r.l. has performed a specific study (report&amp;nbsp; n° 165145/06 of 16.09.06), on request of the Attorney General in the context of the Technical Consultancy Report, aimed to identify the causes which lead to the leak in the pipe.The company has performed a preliminary technical investigation on the event, with the help of external experts and consultants, with the aim to identify the preliminary causes of the accident, and has deposited a technical report at the Attorney General's Office of Siracusa on 19/05/06.The Commission has obtained the information needed to formulate the present Major Accident Report from the two above mentioned reports, from direct discussions with the Company and from other documentation analysed.Official action taken - other official action: 
On 5 may 2006, immediately after the occurrence, the Technical Regional Committee of Sicily met in the premises of the Fire Department in Siracusa, with the goal to discuss the case, the requests request to realise technical modification measures in the installation and the request to present a detailed project for the redesign and improvement of the pipe bundle involved in the accident.The company has complied with the requests, by presenting the project in two phases, NOF which has been already approved by the Regional Technical Committee, and the detailed project which is under examination.Seveso II duties  - remarks:The 2005 safety Report foresaw an accident scenario similar to the one occurred, i.e. the rupture of a gasoline and/or LPG pipeline forming part of a pipe bundle inside a trench in-between a subway and the railway. For the rupture of a gasoline pipe the extension of the damage area had been estimated in maximally 30m, corresponding to a heat irradiation of 3kw/m2 (reversible damage area), involving either road ex SS114 and the railway depending from the source location. Therefore the effects of the heat irradiation foreseen in the accident scenario of the Safety Report are compatible with the effects of the accident which occurred really.The management faults occurred during the event, i.e. the faulty application of the emergency response procedures foreseen in the onsite emergency response plan, points out the need to improve the training of the personnel, with a particular focus on emergency management.Following the event the Regional Technical Committee has delivered the technical feasibility authorisation concerning the reconstruction of the pipe bundle and the repair of the subway (resolution n° 87&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 12/12/06). In March 2007 the company has presented the safety report on the detailed project phase.The municipality of Priolo has not requested the information necessary to prepare a Ajor Accident Report according to DM 9 May 2001.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons:&amp;nbsp; Critical equipment aspects encountered onsite the establishment immediately after the accident:
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the pipe bundle disposition inside the trench and also inside the
subway was such to cause extreme difficulties during the emergency
response operations;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;there was a large number of closely packed pipes, containing
different kinds of liquids (and in particular hazardous ones), which
were not immediately identifiable and traceable;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the presence and vicinity in the same bundle of pipes containing
hazardous substances and pipes with high pressure/temperature steam
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; mix up of the pipe lay-out of utility pipes (and in particular the
extinguishing water pipe) with the product transfer pipes, this
circumstance has caused the overpressure in the isolated pipe tract
exposed to the heat irradiation from the fire and the consequent
explosion of the pipes and interrupted the extinguishing water supply
from the pipe inside the bundle and damaged also another suspended
extinguishing water pipe crossing the pipe bundle;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; high hold-up levels of the tube bundle, due to the reduced number isolating valves on the pipe-lines;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; inadequate gradient arrangement, absence of retaining curbs and of adequate water drainage systems.

Critical management aspects found: 
- Incomplete compliance with the Onsite Emergency Plan: The onsite
fire-brigade was alerted&amp;nbsp; only three hours after the crude oil leak
detection.
- age (more than 25 years) and state of conservation of the pipe
triggering the event, with respect to progressive corrosion processes
encountered, which finally caused the leak;.
The company stated that periodical inspections had been performed
according to the technical "Piping inspection code" API 570 on the
event triggering pipe;
These periodical inspections were part of the establishment's
maintenance program ERG-MED, according to which the last inspection on
the above mentioned pipe had been performed in February 2005. 
Following the accident the company asked the specialist American
company Fluor Daniel to assess the inspection methodology employed by
the company and to propose possible improvements.

The company has realised following structural measures on the installation, with respect to the above mentioned aspects:
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; total reconstruction of the pipe bundle over a length of 300 m,
according to a project integrating the requests formulated by the
Technical Regional Committee of Sicily (resolution CTR dated
05/05/2006) and additional considerations formulated by the company.
The reconstruction and modification project was divided in several phases:
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Phase 1: reactivation of the product loading - unloading wharf
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Phase 2: start up of the pipe lines and plant parts which were not damaged or functionally affected by the fire.
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Phase 3: restoration and modification of the damaged pipes

The reconstruction project of the pipe bundle included in particular:
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; rationalizing the piping layout, according to risk categories, inside of dedicated trench ducts;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Division of the subway in segments with fire resistant
segmentation plates such to separate the pipes according to the
substance categories transported;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Passive fire protection of the steel structures supporting the pipe bundles inside the subway;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Illumination, accessibility and inspectability of the subway
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Installation of:
&amp;nbsp;adequate retaining curbs inside the trench such to limit the extension of fire inside the trench,
&amp;nbsp;paving and drainage systems connected with the establishment sewage system;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Increasing the number of extinguishing monitors, assuring the protection and coverage of the entire trench
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Installation of further Emercency Isolation Valves (EIV) on all
critical pipe lines, the signals of the valves are transmitted to the
control room and to the safety room of the area;
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Installation of Thermal Reaction Valves (TRV) on all isolatable pipe line sections.
The company evaluates to extend the above mentioned technical
improvements to the other subways of the refinery, depending under
other factors from the results of the evaluation by the Technical
Regional Committee (CTR).

Corrective actions in the management:
- On 21/06/06 a meeting of the Safety and Health Committee was
organized, with the goal to analyse the event and point out the lessons
learnt and the measures to be taken.
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Increase the frequency of training courses for the personnel by internal training personnel
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Foresee specific updating courses for the training personnel, and
specific training courses for the department foremen and the management
of the company
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Improve the circulation of the contents of the safety report such to improve the safety consciousness of the personnel
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Identification by the department foremen of sensitive aspects
needing improvement in the Safety Management System (SMS), e.g.
incompleteness or excessive complexity. of the procedures foreseen by
the SMS.
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Identification of behavioural dynamics in the personnel
indicating reduced attention to safety and setting up a safety prize
-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Increase the frequency of training courses for the personnel in
particular concerning the respect of emergency response procedures,
following the cascade principle.
At the date of the present report the company declared to have realised
the majority of the management measures described above: Moreover it is
planned to update the technical and operative documentation related to
the technical modification measures mentioned.

Restore the correct wiring of the fan control in emergency power mode.
Functional tests of the fan in emergency power mode.
Protecting the switch panel from rodents.
Connection of the works gate to the emergency power supply.

Competent authority's response:The failure was caused by a short circuit in the switch panel of a distribution station, which was caused by the ingress of a rodent (dormouse). Despite the fact that the amount of gas released was low and that there was no risk to the public, the lessons learned from this are important for plant safety.

Intrusion by rodents must be avoided or prevented.In general, potential malfunctions caused by animals, e.g. insects, birds, rodents, etc., should be investigated and taken into account in plant operations, e.g. regular checks for animal nests, gnawed components such as cables, rodent droppings in ‘closed spaces’, etc.
Emergency services must be able to access the site at all times.&amp;nbsp;As a result of the power failure, the power-operated gate lost power and had to be opened manually using cranks. Future connection to the emergency power will ensure that the gate can be opened quickly.
Where provision is made to switch over to the emergency power system, this must be checked and, as far as possible, tested in order to ensure full operation.A missing signal cable meant that the boil-off fan could not be activated and the gas could not be transferred to the low-pressure storage tank. As a result, the discharge dampers had to be opened in order to avoid dangerous overpressure.
If the emergency power system had been working properly, there would have been no release of gas despite the power failure.
As the error was caused by a modification in the control room, this event highlights the importance of effective change management for the safety of the plant. Change management must also include appropriate checks and test procedures.

These findings are not only applicable to gas plants or LNG storage facilities. The points listed are of general importance for plant safety and can be applied appropriately on a case-by-case basis.
Covered by operational safety measures (work instructions, safety valves, blowers, Ex zones).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

It was thus put out within 15/20 minutes, with the internal emergency team working for 10 minutes and the fire brigade, which had been called out, working for another 5 minutes. The company deployed the manually operated fixed extinguishing system and used two hydrant-connected UNI45 hoses to put out the flames in station D1, one dry powder extinguisher for the flames engulfing the victim’s legs and a fire blanket on the victim. The emergency was managed by three members of the internal emergency team to put out the fire, two people to give the victim first aid and one person to communicate with outside bodies, the medical emergency services and fire brigade. No alarm was sounded to evacuate staff from the plant, because the evacuation alarm system was undergoing maintenance when the accident occurred. The outside bodies that intervened were: fire brigade teams from the local fire department with specialised NCBR (nuclear, chemical, biological, radiological) support, helicopter ambulance, police forces, local police, health and safety at work service and regional environmental protection agency.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

These are directly linked to the causes and were also included amongst the instructions issued by the ‘Seveso’ control authorities and health authorities in relation to the accident:&amp;nbsp;
the need for the operations prior to filling drums to include a check that the mobile container to be filled has been equipotentially bonded. When the result of this check is negative, it must not be possible for the filling pumps to be started up;there must be a ban on filling drums when the following conditions arise:

malfunctioning of the extractor fan serving the drum-filling area or failure to turn it on;
detection of flammable atmospheres in the drum-filling area, through installation of a system for detecting flammable vapours;
the mobile container has been filled to its maximum capacity for the substance in question;

the risk analysis must cover all possible accident types linked to drum-filling;the risk assessment document for explosions must be updated, ensuring that all items of equipment installed in explosion hazard areas are suitable for those areas based on the area classifications;the safety management system must be re-examined in terms of risk analysis, training of in‑house and outside personnel and operational supervision, particularly for the transfer of flammable liquids into mobile containers. In particular, the training of in-house personnel must be improved as regards the systematic use of the personal protective equipment for product transfer operations.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

At the time of the accident the plant was still at the commissioning stage so there was no experience of operating such a plant. The aim of the commissioning stage is to ensure the process runs as designed and to find appropriate operational and control parameters for the actual production stage. Typically a number of modifications need to be carried out during the commissioning stage. Thus, comprehensive hazard identification and risk assessment play a particularly important role in ensuring the safety of the plant. Close attention should be paid to measures ensuring safe work practices. The competent authority should ensure the characteristics of the commissioning stage are taken into account in the licence conditions.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

It took note of these measures and no objection was made concerning putting the installations back into service.The cleaning of the installations, the repair of the separator unit and the damaged piping, followed by the progressive restarting of the HCN shop, then the TGN, took place from Monday 10th through Thursday 13th April, 2000.Corrective actions at first proposed by the operator:&amp;nbsp;* Immediate modification of the shutdown procedure,&amp;nbsp;* Immediate replacement of air by nitrogen during stripping,&amp;nbsp;* Installation of an analyser in the column's gas exhaust which is independent of the analyser used for the process, and which triggers the emergency shut-down of the stripping process if HCN concentrations &amp;gt; 0.9% are detected,&amp;nbsp;* Installation of a flame protection system between the mist separator and the boiler, in order to avoid any flashbacks.After several further requests, the following additional elements were adopted:&amp;nbsp;* The internal emergency plan is modified: The prefecture, the Regional Directorate For Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE -- Direction REgionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement), and the police will be informed about any gas alarm (even if triggered at very low concentrations) if it lasts longer than 30 min.;&amp;nbsp;* A flame protection system will be installed upstream of the boiler with the next major shutdown of the installations;&amp;nbsp;* The operating mode is modified for the phases following the exhaustion of the HCN reaction chain &amp;nbsp;- in order to reduce the HCN concentration below the LEL concentrations, stripping is begun with nitrogen in the liquid as well as in the gas phase&amp;nbsp;- Change over to air stripping for concentrations below 0.7%;&amp;nbsp;- Lowering of the alarm threshold and installation of a safety system acting on the backflow rate (recirculated rate of flow) of the liquid phase;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Stripping will be continued until a HCN concentration of 1 ppm in the liquid phase is reached.&amp;nbsp;* Moreover, the operator proposes improving the sprinkling with acidic solution inside the column in order to avoid the risk of polymerisation caused by low acidity.&amp;nbsp;* Analysis of two possible worsening scenarios for the accident of 29 March 2000:&amp;nbsp;- shut-off failure of the tank valves: the release would have continued with 1 t/h of N2 with 2,6% of HCN, i.e. with 26 kg/h of HCN and a lethal limit zone (ZOLEM zone limite effets mortels) below 50 m;&amp;nbsp;- Propagation of the explosion beyond the .droplet separation vessel up to the .absorption column head and bursting of the latter. Release from the .column head of 30 t/h of air with 5.6% HCN, at a height of 30 m, and the formation of a pool on the ground with a maximum concentration of 5.6% HCN &amp;nbsp;# First release of 0.5 kg/s HCN : a limit zone between reversible/irreversible effects of 230 m.&amp;nbsp;# Evaporation of the pool: limit zone between reversible/irreversible effects of the first scenario-&amp;nbsp; limit zone between reversible/irreversible effects of the worst case scenario considered for the modification project for the installation.&amp;nbsp;The effects of such an accident would not go beyond the boundaries of the site.&amp;nbsp;* Launching of an inspection program for procedures and instrumentation during start-up and shut-down phases: 38 situation data sheets have been prepared.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The recommendations are general, concerning the entire industry and similar projects.Recommendations for the purposes of supervision and the industry:• Guidelines should be observed. Regular training on the operational guidelines should be organized and it must be supervised so that the employees become acquainted with and comply with the guidelines. Important operational guidelines in terms of safety include organizational responsibilities, identification and assessment of hazards, change management, work instructions and management of deviations.• Procedures and guidelines based on quality, and environmental and occupational health and safety standards presented in the operating system should be specified from the viewpoint of industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety. The (major accident) hazards related to them should be identified and managed in a systematic way. The functionality of the management system should be ensured and the development needs should be systematically identified also in terms of the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and process safety.• The organization's functionality should be ensured in connection with organizational, personnel and process changes and when responsibilities change. The operating system should be kept up-to-date.• The persons in charge at the production plant and those planning and implementing the changes should be acquainted with the organization’s change management procedures, which should be followed when changes are made in the production plant.• The protection plan should be developed in line with preventive risk management; the current nature of the protection plan is to react strongly to accidents.• In hazard identification and risk assessment, chemical safety should also be taken into account with the same degree of importance as explosives safety. The assessment team must include members with expertise in chemicals and the production process, and employees at the work site must be consulted.• It must be ensured that the employees are familiar with the work instructions and risk factors in their workplace and are able to identify them. Guidelines should be provided for the supervision of compliance with the safety and work instructions.• The processing of safety observations must have a follow-up procedure that motivates the employees to make safety observations.• Guidelines are to be drawn up for health and safety know-how and training procedures, and it should be ensured that the training needs for the personnel at the production plant are identified and determined in safety-related issues as well. Safety training should also be maintained and recorded.• The flow of information between contract partners operating in the plant area and the plant’s personnel should be ensured.• Guidelines concerning the reaction to alarms are to be specified further. The causes of and reasons for alarms and the measures carried out should be recorded. The frequency of alarms should be monitored and the reason for recurring alarms should be tackled.• The monitoring of ongoing requirements by the authorities should be included as part of the systematic monitoring of deviations so that the requirements issued by the authorities are met within the specified time, or additional time can be applied for if necessary. Recommendations for the inspection body:• The validity of the area classification should be verified in connection with electrical inspections.Recommendations for focusing and developing Tukes’s supervision and communication:• During periodic inspections, the functionality of the operating system and the awareness and observance of guidelines should be verified at all organizational levels.• Risk management regarding the industrial handling and storage of hazardous chemicals and the special characteristics of process safety compared with the safety systems related to quality control, environmental and occupational health should be emphasized in supervision and communications.Recommendations for the development of legislation:• The application of chemical legislation in the manufacture of explosives is to be clarified. The legislation should also support chemical safety in the explosives industry.• The area classifications concerning explosive air mixtures and explosives applied in the explosives industry are to be clarified.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emergency action was conducted by the Fire Service. Activities consisted in providing 3 currents of water in attack and 1 current in defense. The currents of water were directed to the part of the hall, where the drying process of benzoyl peroxide and tanks with a benzoyl water slurry followed, while the current in defense was directed to the reactors. After the arrival of additional forces and measures, the activities have expanded to include 9 water currents and 2 froth currents. These activities contributed to extinguishing the fire. The next actions consisted of cooling the production line for benzoyl peroxide and trays in the dryer. Before the arrival of the Fire Service, 41 employees were evacuated from the establishment. In addition, the company's employees, at the beginning of the fire, moved the pallet containers with benzoyl chloride to a safe place, which were placed directly next to the hall (about 10 pieces). The residents of the neighbouring Social Welfare Home were evacuated and moved to a safe place. The evacuation began at 10:00 am and ended at 2:45 pm. Residential buildings, workplaces and&amp;nbsp; Information on accident was provided to nearby residential buildings and public facilities by telephone and on the spot directly by Police and City Guard officers using a megaphone.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The actions taken in order to reoccurrence of a similar accident:
1) Separation of the production installations (in two different buildings);
2) Application of one-piece-flow rule in order to minimize the quantity of dangerous substances present;
3) Sprinkler system densification in the critical parts of the production process;
4) Double protection measures for process temperature control in order to prevent overheating and loss of process control;
5) Creation of „independent fire zones” allowing separation of process phases (synthesis, washing, product packing);
6) Arrangement of the production unit on a greater space (~500 m2) – bigger distance between pieces of equipment;
7) Change in drying phase – application of a dryer with a small working load;
8) Shortening of the periods between technical checks of the equipment,
9) More trainings for the staff.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Examinations and tests carried out during attempts to reproduce conditions that could have given rise to the seal failure failed to identify any faults with the cup and grip seal and the small quantity of water found in the seal cup after the incident suggests that the incident may have occurred due to either a leakage of water from the seal cup or a failure to adequately replenish water in the cup at the time the cup and grip mechanism was dipped in the ground water tank.

In order to minimize the amount of flammable substances involved, the isolation of various sections of the plant was carried out. Nitrogen purging of the system was carried out. The adjacent installations were protected by applying cooling water. The fire was extinguished by the intervention of operators, the plant fire brigade and the local fire brigade. The fire fighting water was collected in a basin and disposed for treatment in the biological waste-water treatment plant of the establishment. Ambient air monitoring inside the establishment revealed no presence of hazardous substances in the environment.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On-site fire brigade and external brigade attended.&amp;nbsp; Personnel to muster points.&amp;nbsp; Decontamination of site underway, mainly for asbestos.&amp;nbsp; No disruption to public.Emergency measures - Remarks: Having been informed of the leak, the control room operator isolated the feeds to the "light ends" system using the distributed control system (DCS) and within two minutes, despite the number of audible and visual alarms, significant isolation of inventories had taken place. The damage to instrumentation during the fire also meant that the control room operator was unable to view the condition of parts of the process through the DCS system.In response to the original identification of the leak, the on-site emergency services were called to attend (03:21 a.m.) and by the time they arrived at the scene, ignition had occurred. They quickly set up portable fire appliances to control the spread of the fire.The Central Scotland Fire Brigade was notified by a 999 call at 03:29 a.m. following the ignition. They arrived at the scene at 03.39 a.m. and assisted in controlling the incident. The fire was initially attended by five mobile units along with a decontamination and control unit. Subsequently a further five mobile units attended with a standby foam tanker.At 03.33 a.m. the Oil Refinery muster point alarm was sounded.Plant operators helped the emergency services by closing manual valves (for example at the fractionator column) and by shutting down pumps to minimise the quantity of material released. The control room operator was limited in the extent to which he could assist to isolate inventories remotely because many isolations could only be done manually.The BP Grangemouth Incident Management Team was called out and within 30 minutes the Grangemouth Petrochemical Complex Major Incident Control Committee (MICC) had been activated at Grangemouth police station. Some difficulties were experienced with the reception of emergency responders and with MICC communications. Control of the access to the incident site was initially difficult to achieve.The fire reached its maximum intensity within 20 minutes but within 40 minutes started to decline as a result of a reduction in available fuel and the use of aggressive fire-fighting techniques (water and foam). Within 90 minutes the fire size had reduced considerably to the point where the remaining inventory could be allowed to burn off.The incident was brought under control and several hours later (around 10:00 a.m.) the incident was declared to be over. Damage was mainly limited to columns and associated equipment on the "light ends" section in the vicinity of column E5. Passive structural fire protection prevented significant damage to surrounding structures.During the initial incident response, consideration was not given to the potential asbestos hazard to fire-fighting teams. It was only later that it was suspected that asbestos from vessel/piping insulation may have become damaged either directly by the fire or by the fire-fighting attempts and tests were carried out to determine the extent (if any) of the asbestos contamination. Whilst most of the asbestos was retained on the plant, some asbestos material was subsequently found in the plant drains, most probably as a result of having been deposited by firewater.&amp;nbsp; There was no evidence of air-borne asbestos having been deposited outside the plant area. For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the response to asbestos concerns see the asbestos investigation in the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/index.htm.Gas sampling carried out on the north bank of the River Forth found no abnormal levels of atmospheric pollutants following the incident. Towards the end of the incident, due to the large quantity of water used for fire-fighting, and the fact that the capacity of the storm water tanks was effectively reduced by recent heavy rain, the storm water tanks in the Oil Refinery effluent treatment system became filled. Contaminated effluent from the FCCU containing hydrocarbon liquids was diverted directly into the Forth Estuary.BP made the plant safe by isolating sections of the plant using existing valves and then by determining how to safely dispose of inventories of flammable material. There was substantial damage to high-level steelwork and access to parts of the site of the fire was restricted until the danger from falling steelwork had been assessed.The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility.For a summary of the key findings of the investigation into the environmental impact of the FCCU fire see the environmental impact investigation in the HSE report at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/invest/response.htm.Official action taken - legal action: The HSE alleged breaches of health and safety law and BP Grangemouth Oil Refinery Limited were served with an indictment for breaches of the Health &amp;amp; Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 Section 2. The company was found guilty and fined £750,000.An Improvement Notice was served on the company relating to asbestos management.Official action taken - other action: Following this incident (and two other non-reportable incidents which occurred at the same establishment between 29 May and 10 June 2000), the UK's Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (HSE) agreed that the HSE would prepare a non-statutory report on the incidents and would make it available to the public in accordance with the HSE's policies. The&amp;nbsp; "Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000" (available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk/comah/bpgrange/index.htm) explains how and why the incidents occurred, and summarises the subsequent investigations carried out by the Competent Authority and by BP.The report seeks to reassure the public that a series of thorough and detailed investigations into the causes of the incidents have been carried out by all parties concerned. In addition the report is intended to demonstrate that a number of lessons have been learned both by BP and by the regulators, and actions have been taken in order to improve safety performance at the complex. The report is also intended to be viewed by a wider audience of companies, safety professionals and Trade Union representatives involved in the major accident hazard industries and to serve as a reminder of many of the issues that need to be addressed by safety reports for major hazard installations. Operators of major hazard sites are expected to carefully consider the contents of this report and the HSE will use Trade Association contacts, plus site inspection plans and other means, to publicise the incidents and to ensure the lessons are widely learned.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) "light ends" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Demonstration that the mechanical integrity of pipework on the "light ends" section of the FCCU is assured, in particular, with respect to the following:a. Stresses caused by: ·Fabrication;Assembly and erection, including misalignment and structural attachments;Mechanically induced vibration cycling;Temperature effects and thermal cycling;Self weight and effect of supports, restraints and guides;Reaction forces and other shock loading;Pressure;Erosion, corrosion and environmental cracking.b. Dead legs and drain points to be minimised and, where retained, assessed against the above failure modes.c. Redundant equipment and pipework, including drain/vent points, to be removed, where practicable.The HSE investigation also recommended that improvements be made in the following areas of FCCU operation:-Change control - rigorous change control procedures should be employed.Risk assessment - a review of the FCCU risk assessment should be undertaken which considers critical process effects on start-up, e.g. de-watering, opening FCVs, exceeding process parameters, thermal cycling, transmitted vibration etc.Control/instrumentation/electrical equipment.Management review - a high level overview of unit operations should be maintained to ensure abnormal operation of the process plant is identified and the full implications assessed.Communications/competency - process technicians should receive additional training and instructions to enable them to recognise situations where there may be serious implications for process plant. BP confirmed that these recommendations would be addressed before the FCCU was started up again and would be dealt with in the design of the revamped "light ends" section.Measures to mitigate consequences:The Competent Authority investigation required that BP should take the following measures before re-introduction of hydrocarbon to the Fluidised Catalytic Cracker Unit (FCCU) "light ends" section. The incident has substantial commercial implications for the site. (The FCCU is currently not operational whilst BP are evaluating the option of re-building the facility).Emergency Shutdown ArrangementsDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified for the emergency shutdown of the "light ends" section of the FCCU need to be considered (in particular the following):a. Installation of remotely operated shut-off valves (ROSOVs) to allow rapid remote isolation of significant process inventories in order to minimise the consequences of an uncontrolled leak and allow remote emergency shutdown of ancillary equipment, such as pumps;b. Safe means for emergency depressurisation of columns or vessels, where reasonably practicable.Alarm FloodingDemonstration that adequate arrangements have been identified to ensure a timely and effective response by Central Control Building operators to those alarms necessary for the prevention and mitigation of major accidents, taking due account of the number, presentation and rate of presentation of alarms during plant start up, or other upset conditions, and any relevant factors set out in industry best practice guidelines (the Engineering Equipment and Material User's Association (EEMUA) guidelines).BP has implemented a range of measures to address these issues. Emergency response plans have now been updated to an agreed format and include reference where required to radioactive sources.&amp;nbsp; Storm water tank capacity is being reviewed as part of the Complex sustaining capital programme.&amp;nbsp; Procedures have been established to address the possible release of a range of substances into the effluent treatment plant during a fire or major incident.BP have reviewed and improved the on-site incident management plan.&amp;nbsp; Area fire plans have been updated to the agreed format. A full review of the on-site emergency support provision has been carried out and improvements to the team organisation and facilities have been implemented.BP recognised the problems caused by alarm flooding and work had been commenced at the site to address the problem. A project is now under way to put software in place to manage the prioritisation of alarms properly. The projected timescale of 5 years for completion has been accepted by the Competent Authority.BP also carried out their own investigation into this incident. This resulted in a new site-wide emergency response procedure being issued to address handling asbestos and ceramic fibres during emergencies.Useful References:The official report into incident "Major incident investigation report - BP Grangemouth: 29 May - 10 June 2000" is available at the HSE website at www.hse.gov.uk./comah/bpgrange/index.htm.Alarm HandlingCHIS6 - HSE Information Sheet: Chemicals Sheet No 6 - Better alarm handlingTo download see www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/chis6.pdfEEMUA Guidance - Alarm systems, a guide to design, management and procurement.

During earlier visits Seveso inspectors diagnosed a insufficient inspection system. Although some work was already done to select a better system, by the time of the phenol leak, this new inspection system wasn't completely in place yet.- Replace the gaskets more frequently. The used gasket was a "Vitton" gasket. According to the supplier data, Vitton gaskets are phenol-resistant, but the facts prove that after many years the gaskets aren't phenolproof anymore.- Better design of the manual valve (outside of the cup tank instead of between the 2 shells).- Better working procedures (closing the manual valve after each run of phenol based production batches or at the end of the working week)</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After detection of the fire the on-site fire brigade made an initial attempt to extinguish the fire which was unsuccessful, the fire brigade of the nearby city alerted for support arrived rapidly. The off-site fire brigade requested reinforcement from other fire-brigades in neighbouring cities and departments (regions), once confronted with the rapid spread of the fire. A total of 500 firemen were involved in the emergency response operations with a peak of 130 firemen simultaneously.The favourable environmental conditions for the dispersion of the smoke cloud associated with the absence strong wind were favourable to the emergency response operations and have permitted to avoid spreading the fire to adjoining buildings. In fact an important assembling shop and a research laboratory adjoining the building are of a fundamental importance for the operation of the site and of the company.Large amounts of emulsifiers were needed for the fire fighting operations, in fact of 100.000 litres of used estimates that 90.000 m3 requisitioned i the Auvergne region 80.000 were used for the fire-fighting operations. An analysis of the amounts of water used estimates that 90.000 m3 of extinguishing water were used during operation to extinguish the fire, a third of which were used by the sprinkling systems.While during the fire and in the following weeks, attention in the press was primarily drawn on the large smoke cloud which could be observed during extinguishing operations, actions taken by the public authorities and DRIRE have taken all possible hazards into account as soon as the accident happened.It should be noted, however, that the facility does not present elements making any major hazard as likely&amp;nbsp; (absence of a significant inventory of toxic products, easily flammable products or explosive substances, etc.).&amp;nbsp;</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With hindsight, knowing how difficult it is to extinguish a large rubber fire, it seems that the fire could have been controlled and extinguished much better, if the means of response, which were limited, had been faster..&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The time delay between the start of the fire and the decision to inundate ("deluge") the storage facility appears to be rather long (1h20). The absence of automatic systems highlighted the fact that it was impossible to activate manually the relevant devices, as they were not accessible, being located in the immediate proximity of the flames rather than outside the building. Wherever the sprinkling valves could be activated quickly, the stocks were protected and the fire prevented.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Particular attention should be given to hazardous substances (distribution, storage and traceability), to the capacity for quick and automatic response in case of an accident, to the creation of emulsifier stocks (sufficient quantities), to the preparation of retention ponds which are adequately sized for the extinguishing water in case of a fire.Although the incapacity to retain the extinguishing water appears to have had no consequences, it has become the subject of intense considerations which aim to find solutions that can be applied also to all other establishments of the same type.Moreover, in the light of the results of the technical inquiry being carried out in relation to the accident, corrective measures have been prescribed. Generally speaking, a risk assessment and an evaluation of the prevention measures have been undertaken (updating of the hazard studies, consideration of possible domino effects, possible third party expert evaluations).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emergency actions developed and implemented in cooperation between operator and service provider, including:

A rail operations ‘safety scout’, i.e. an experienced worker from the operator, to check and advise on site, across shifts.
Additional service provider support needed on loading yard tracks 17/18 by the service provider’s shift supervisor, particularly at the beginning of shifts.
Safety devices (e.g. stop blocks) to stop tank wagons rolling away once they have been halted on track 17/18 and on track 13 to be placed at the appropriate southerly point to prevent runaway tank wagons.

Other actions:

Description and assessment of operator/service provider interfaces to identify potential managerial and communications improvements.
Consistent involvement of the service provider. Based on the interfaces found, develop points of focus and adapt stakeholder tasks at operator/service provider interfaces. In the process, monitor common operating points.
Alignment of instructions. On the aforementioned basis, supplement, update and harmonise instructions.
Review and optimise the shift handover. Clearly structure and define the content and process at shift handover with the service provider and also describe the process in the form of written instructions.
Adapt the job description for the shift manager.
Review and optimise the training process. Based on the review, adapt training so that its content and methodology are appropriate to the target groups. Here, risks and risk awareness during shunting and filling should provide the focal point.
Deploy technical safety actions to prevent runaway tank wagons (in this instance, a tank wagon brake on the track).

As described, the causes were multi-layered, inter alia the link between the incident and the shift handover. It is important at shift handover for there to be comprehensive communication about the tasks and conditions found on site at that specific moment. Appropriate standards should be established to this end and documentation produced accordingly.
Rule violations are another aspect of the incident. In routine activities, it is common for sequential short cuts or negligence to occur (wittingly or unwittingly); if undetected or without repercussions (in terms of either detecting an issue or sanctioning it), they take root and go unrectified. It is important therefore when monitoring the safety management system to ensure compliance with safety regulations and to take prompt corrective action if shortcomings are identified. Academic literature refers to a ‘drift to danger’ (Rasmussen, 1997) or to a ‘normalisation of deviance’ (Vaughan, 1996). The ‘drift to danger’ caused by external pressures or the acceptance of ‘deviances’ because they have not resulted in ‘disasters’ are a major challenge for complex organisations, in particular those dealing with hazardous substances and processes. A robust, mature safety culture can counter this by establishing unequivocal values which are exemplified by management and by promoting open communication in all directions.
The fact that a service provider’s actions caused the incident shows that interfaces between operator, service provider and monitoring are particularly important for allowing the service provider to take the appropriate safety action.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The area of the neighbouring facility lies currently idle. Therefore, no technical or organisational measures can be formulated for this specific case.A consequence should, however, be that in case of a densely built-up area (here: estimated distance from industrial building to industrial building ca. 6m) the neighbouring facilities should be checked regarding the possibility of causing a domino effect. This also applies to facilities, that do not fall under the provisions of the Seveso Directive.

1- alternative escape routes from scaffold platforms or any work area must always be available;
2- staff on the work must be equipped with flash-fire suits;
3- remove personnel away when the final lift is carried out;
4- drench the valve removal area and scaffold platforms with ground-level fire monitors as the lift is carried out;

At the time of the explosion, 6 employees, including the manager and superintendent, gathered outside a doorway on the upper level while a seventh was on the lower level by the lab. The employee on the lower level was killed, while those outside the doorway were injured, two of them seriously.The company was unprepared for an emergency. Specifically:- The Emergency Action Plan did not list events or describe situations that might necessitate a plant evacuation.- Operating procedure did not specify employees' actions in the event of a chemical release or loss of reactor control.- Employees were not trained on the Emergency Action Plan and evacuation drills were not conducted.- The facility was not equipped with an emergency alarm system.The Department of Public Safety responded rapidly and called in mutual aid support from County and nearby municipalities. Employees and Public Safety officers assisted injured employees.The fires following the explosion generated thick smoke, and local residents were asked to shelter in-place for several hours. The fires were extinguished the next day.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This incident provides important lessons for manufacturers with operations involving reactive chemistryIDENTIFY AND CONTROL REACTIVE HAZARDSManufacturers should take a comprehensive approach, and:- Identify and characterize reactive hazards.- Systematically evaluate what can go wrong, including mis-charging of reagents, loss of cooling, instrument malfunction, and other credible failure scenarios.- Implement, document, and maintain adequate safeguards against identified failure scenarios. Multiple, independent safeguards may be needed to reliably ensure the safety of the reactive process.CONTROL CHANGEChemical manufacturers and others with reactive chemistry operations should control changes to batch recipes, including key operating conditions, such as:- The quantities, proportions and sequencing of reactor feeds.- Reaction temperature.- Conditions that could cause initiator or monomer accumulation.- Conditions that could affect the deactivation of monomer inhibitors or stabilizers.MAINTAIN PROCESS EQUIPMENT CAPABILITYManufacturers with reactive chemistry operations should:- Document the perfromance requirements and capabilities of process equipment, such as the reactor condenser at the installation where the accident took place.- Periodically inspect and service process equipment, including the water side of the heat exchangers, to maintain appropriate safety margins.TRAIN PERSONNEL ON HAZARDS PROCEDURESManufacturers should ensure that worker training includes:- The nature of the reactive hazards, including process safety margins.- Operating procedures, including appropriate cautions and warnings, the consequences of deviations, recognition of deviations and abnormal operations, and the appropriate responses to control or mitigate the effects.PREPARE FOR EMERGENCIESManufacturers should:- Implement an effective emergency plan.- Train employees on the plan.- Install an evacuation alarm system that is audible and/or visible throughout the facility.- Conduct regular exercises to help ensure rapid evacuation to a safe location in an emergency.- Coordinate their emergency planning with offsite response organizations and the Local Emergency Planning Committee.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

They water the leak with water, thus worsening the product release. Called in firefighters from the nearest American military base shall ensure themselves the closure of the circulation around the plant to prevent residents and cars circulate through the toxic cloud that formed. They alert the local police to continue this work and is responsible for the evacuation of the population within 1.5 km. The slow response of the authorities has been criticized, the 300 residents directly affected being evacuated until 10 days after the accident, as well as insufficient resources available to the emergency, including the lack of neutralizing agents (lime) during the first 22 intervention hours. Within 20 km, declared "disaster area" land must be cleared in the following weeks, as well as buildings. Riparian evacuees will be an epidemiological study. The first evidence gathered by the police records from a surveillance camera of the transfer station and review of the tanker crashed in particular, show that two employees are mounted on the tank to connect the air hose designed to drive acid in the tank from the tank; one branch air hose, while the second to save time begins to loosen the bolts on the valve buffer output of acid. The latter then accidentally struck the arm of the manual outlet valve, which opens partially allowing the HF pressure to spring.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">At the moment when the fire broke out in the departments affected by the incident, 14 employees were present, of whom two fire officers, plus two external workers. Given the presence of flames in the upper level area, the workers intervened immediately, as provided for in the Emergency Intervention Plan (PEI), and tried to extinguish them with portable fire extinguishers. Although the fire extinguishers were used promptly, they were not sufficient to put out the flames, given that the fire had spread with extreme speed and reached the roofing panels. The foreman (and the fire safety officer), having realised that it was not possible to tackle the emergency with the firefighting equipment on site, ordered the evacuation of all workers present and took steps to secure the plant, specifically by: turning off the electricity in the area affected by the fire and the immediate vicinity; cutting off the gas and liquid fuel supply. At the same time, the other fire safety officer called the Fire Brigade. When the fire brigade and ambulance service arrived on the scene, at around 14.05, a considerable area of the plant was already on fire and - to be more precise - the west wing, partly used for production and partly as a store for polyurethane sandwich panels. Given the speed with which the blaze spread, aided by the wind, and the intense production of thick black smoke, the combustibility of the products present, the huge quantities of product in storage and finally the presence of a storage tank of inflammable liquids (polyol and isocyanate), the sole operational possibility was to avoid the fire spreading to other adjacent areas both to the east and the west. The laminated wooden frame connecting the reinforced concrete and metal load bearing pillars was totally burned in the fire, causing the structural collapse of the roof and the lateral buffer walls, which imploded.
At approximately 19.00, the moment at which the flammable liquids in the metal above-ground storage tanks located to the west of the plant stopped burning, the fire could be considered under control, although the material stacked inside continued to produce flames and smoke even after that time. The extinguishing operation continued throughout the night and part of the next day.
Overall 22 fire engines and other devices, including a helicopter and an air tank, were used to extinguish the fire, contributed by various Fire Brigades. All the staff present implemented the internal emergency plan properly. The prompt activation of the emergency plan meant that all the workers were grouped together in a safe area and the fire was prevented from spreading to the dangerous substances on site in the plant. The external emergency plan was also activated. The technical departments of the relevant health and environmental agencies were instructed to monitor and test the water, air and soil in the province concerned and the neighbouring province. Pending the results of the monitoring and tests, the mayors of the relevant municipalities issued emergency orders adopting a series of precautionary measure to protect public health. The measures were maintained for ten days, until the test results received back from the various laboratories confirmed that the concentrations were below legal limits in all environmental media (air, water and soil).
After the emergency, and the clean up of the water used to extinguish the fire inside the building that was collected in the water recovery system and of the surrounding area, the plant restarted operations immediately.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The need to ensure that areas where processes requiring heat are carried out are totally secured;&amp;nbsp;

the need to set up specific procedures for work permits in order to properly manage contracted work; the work permit must be drawn up and tailored to the specific work to be performed; it needs to identify the individual transfers of responsibility for performing the various steps in the work process between the company and the external companies, define the specific risks in the work environment, how to make them safe and by what means, specify the result of the action taken and how to put the plant back into operation;
the need for external companies used to outsource specific tasks to be adequately informed, trained and verified with regard to the risks associated with the work to be carried out on site;
the need to properly define the criteria for selecting the companies used for outsourcing, especially those carrying out hot work;
the need properly audit the company’s SMS management system, to as to bring any shortcomings in the system to light.

More generally, manufacturing companies where negligible quantities of dangerous substances are used only peripherally in the production process, and that play a peripheral role with regard to the volume of production and the quantities of the finished products produced, have a tendency to consider their actual conditions as ‘less critical’ compared to other Seveso cases, and therefore to adopt an SMS that is generally ‘not sufficient’ to securely manage a context that should not in actual fact be underestimated (the presence of considerable quantities of combustible material) for its potential to increase the seriousness of any potential accident.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

the future by applying the directives of the so called "SEVESO II" on
the land use planning in case of a plant with the risk of major
accidents.Measures to prevent recurrence: Realize in the future, in harmony with the "SEVESO II" directive and adequate planning policy of land use not allowing residential expansion near the high risk plants. Making more serious the obligations of the hazardous plants' operators in matter of safety and personnel training at every level of responsibility. In preparing emergency plans, internal or external, the consequences of any possible major accident should be taken into consideration independently from their more or less high probability obtained by the analysis of the safety report.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The leak section was isolated and the failed pipe was fitted with a temporary patch. The internal emergency teams were activated and water sprays used to knock down vapours and to dilute the spillage (washed to effluent treatment plant). About thirty appliances were deployed during the accident.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site major emergency plan was activated but little action was required as no real off-site effects. Gas detection was carried out in a North East direction from the release point. Approximately 2,500 people were advised to stay in their homes.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Official action taken - other official action: When the Original Report was prepared, a Prohibition Notice served to prevent the operation of the plant until the investigations have not been completed and any remedial measures (that the investigations showed to be necessary) have fully implemented. In any case, the plant may not operate again because, due to the Montreal Protocol about the ChloroFluoroCarbons, it has to be closed soon.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

One pipe on another plant had to be monitored regularly for the limited remaining life of the plant itself. Actually, all the "registered" pipework (that is all the pipework where a major accident hazard could be expected), have to be periodically inspected. In future, all the pipework where the consequences of a failure are unacceptable, irrespective of the failure mechanism, will be subjected to inspection procedures.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

At 14:30, a 26% level of O2 was recorded at a distance of 5 m from the isolated section. The operator informed its clients and issued a press release at 18:00 hrs. An uncovered O2 pipe and an N2 pipe also passing through concrete beneath the rails were near the damaged structure. The nearby N2 pipe that feeds the safety systems of several sites could have been damaged, risking a rupture. This pipeline could not be closed off without causing a shutdown of the client installations.
The environmental administration called for a security perimeter to be established around the oxygen pipe, a lowering of the N2 pressure and the installation of a security camera. Under the 'pipelines legislation', a prefectoral order confirmed these points and requested expert opinions on the metallurgy of the damaged pipe and the geotechnical aspects of the manner in which it was laid.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The lessons to be learned include:
- the activation of the emergency response plan (compulsory for upper tier Seveso plant), since the accident was on the edge of the factory's property, on a section of transport infrastructure and not a 'factory pipeline'; the extent of the following should be specified in the safety analyses: the degree of covering of the pipe in the emergency response plan.
- safety studies regarding laying techniques and the local hydrogeological / geotechnical characteristics in order to better understand the geological uncertainty caused by groundwater fluctuations,
- the distances of the effects of the 'violent rupture': crater, wall, projectiles. Besides the findings of the 'security studies' for the operator to verify, the ELS, PEL and IRE zones for such pipelines could be reviewed.
- apart from contracted work or earth movements, corrosion as the initiator of a rupture.

At around 03:20, two external sensors detected a minor leak at the large door to the chamber (between 0.5 and 1 ppm). The phosgene dispersed throughout the chamber&amp;nbsp; was sucked into the soda-ash packed tower scrubbers, which neutralised it by that evening.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The valve was changed and qualification-tested again. The main door bolts (20 of the 460 bolts were found to be loose) and the inflatable seals of the 2 related airlocks (dried out or corroded) were replaced. All the openings of the containment chamber were checked.
The operator made improvements to the formal procedure for testing equipment after cleaning: systematic acceptance of the work carried out by subcontractors, systematic helium leak testing of the valve.
The graphite seal technology was changed (from B29 to spiral type). Awareness and other training was organised for subcontractors (identification and tracking of seals). The chamber is to be pressure-tested every time the large door to the chamber is opened.&amp;nbsp; The bolts were replaced with non-deformable bolts.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate firefighting and rescue measures: The local authorities and several governmental departments activated emergency centres, the municipality set up a support centre for the population and the operator installed a crisis centre within the establishment. The PPI (special administrative accident response plan) and the plant’s emergency plan were put into action; reinforcements were requested to assist the departmental firemen, the civil protection mobilised a chemical hazard evaluation cell and technological catastrophe specialists. During the first 6 days,1,430 people were thus mobilised, including 460 firemen from the region, 620 firemen from other districts and 350 military personnel of the UIISC (civil security units). Roughly fifty doctors, 32 nurses or health care practitioners and more than 80 ambulance drivers were also mobilised. The monitoring of access routes, looting protection and guarding required 500 to 600 policemen and 13 companies of special CRS (riot control) policemen rotating between September 21 to October 3, 2001. Crisis management operations also mobilised 350 police officers plus 80 belonging to a mobile squad; primarily for traffic control, reinforcement and sanitary convoys. Considering the extent of the collateral damage and the inherent risks, numerous buildings and schools were evacuated. A security perimeter was set up in a radius of 500 m around the site. Thoroughfares around the site were closed. Traffic on the freeway, the southern ring road, the A62 and A64 motorways, the RN 20 highway, the metro, the railway station and Blagnac airport were interrupted. The numerous injured are admitted to local hospitals. The population was ordered to remain confined as a precautionary measure and masks were distributed around the site. In late morning, the Prefecture announced that the toxic risk was under control and that all danger of atmospheric pollution had been dismissed. The precautionary confinement order was lifted around 4.00 pm, and rail and air traffic was reestablished. Nevertheless, the population was asked not to consume the tap water. The pollution of the Garonne was also brought under control.The PPI was lifted September 28, 1.00 pm.
Securing of the site: At the request of the classified facilities inspectorate and according to an emergency procedure, on September 21, 2001 the Préfet issued an order suspending the activity of 6 companies operating within the chemical zone (AZF, SNPE, TOLOCHIMIE, ISOCHEM, AIR LIQUIDE and RAISIO) requiring them to secure their sites. One company, SOFERTI in Fenouillet, which recycles off-spec products coming from the storage facility that exploded, was also the subject of an emergency prefectoral order requesting it to secure its chemical substances; inerting operations were set up for this purpose. The crisis centre of the inspectorate remained active for 3 weeks after the accident in order to ensure that the various sites were secure.The securing of AZF site included several delicate operations: recovery and removal of stocks of ammonium nitrate in hot solution, industrial nitrates buried near the crater, liquefied ammonia, nitric acid… Expert evaluation and validation of the procedures were requested prior to certain operations. During the drainage of a liquefied ammonia storage tank, an uncontrolled release of approximately 9 tons of ammoniated solution resulted in pollution of the Garonne and fish mortality. It took several months to secure the AZF site and the other plants concerned, which namely involved the evacuation of dangerous substances. At the request of the Préfet, the corresponding operations were carried out by the operators under the control of the inspectorate. In this manner, according to the latter’s estimates and for the AZF plant alone, 4,000 tons of agricultural nitrates (fertilizer) and 800 tons of industrial nitrates buried under the gravel and rubble of buildings destroyed by the explosion, were to be cleared out and removed in the 4 months following the explosion. SNPE, ISOCHEM and TOLOCHIMIE were required to conduct an audit of the property damage and conduct analysis of the safety conditions. Based on a proposal by the inspectorate, the Préfet also required that a third-party expert evaluation be conducted, as defined in article 3-6 of the order dated 09/21/77. In addition to this,150 agricultural or industrial ammonium nitrate storage installations are monitored throughout France
Remedial :The remediation of the site led by the operator aimed essentially at reducing the concentrations of hydrocarbons, lead, arsenic and mercury in soil. In July 2006, after two years of work, more than 750,000 cubic meters of earth had been excavated, nearly 90% of the contaminated earth and concrete had been depolluted through on-site washing and heat treatment at 850 ° C. Depollution work is completed in early 2008. The operator estimates the cost of clean up measures at 100 million Euros .In autumn 2006, the construction of a cancerology center is announced on the site of the former AZF plant. The center will ultimately house 4,000 people, mostly researchers, on a campus of 220 ha. The Pierre Potier research Institute is inaugurated in late 2009, joined in 2010 by pharmaceutical companies. Finally, the University Hospital of Cancer, whose construction began in late 2009, opened in 2013.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">An inquiry by the Parliamentary Commission was opened October 24, 2001 relative to the safety of industrial installations and research centres, and relative to the protection of persons and the environment in the case of a major industrial accident. As of January 29, 2002, this commission had formulated 90 proposals along six major themes: reducing the risk at the source, the human factor notably with the employees playing a role in the prevention of accidents, the implementation of greater openness and pluralistic expertise with regard to disasters, urban planning questions, the adaptation of judicial procedures and the compensation of the victims of industrial catastrophes.
Within a few months, the French public authorities undertook different reflective thinking and actions: In the field of prevention, in order to: -Broaden the field of application of the SEVESO 2 directive by lowering the ammonium nitrate threshold, - Limit the risk presented by ammonium nitrate-based fertilizers by adapting their technical specifications to make them intrinsically less explosive, - Improve the prevention of major accident risks in ports and railroad yards, - Ensure the continuity of the security between fixed installations and the transport of dangerous substances, - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the hazards associated with ammonium nitrates (fertilizer and industrial nitrates), - Reinforce the exchanges between member States relative to the cohabitation of activities at risk with other economic activities, residential housing and thoroughfares, - Harmonise the risk evaluation methods between France and the member States, - Access to improved harmonisation of methods and inspection means of establishments at risk by the public authorities, - Reinforce cooperation between research and expert assessment organisations in the European Union, - Re-examine the safety conditions of high-level SEVESO facilities,
O In the field of inspection, in order to:- Reinforce significantly the staff of the inspectorate - Reinforce the inspectorate through technical support for the examination of danger studies, - Check the fertilizer storage and ammonium nitrate storage facilities governed by the environmental legislation. O In the field of openness and information to: - Create more than 200 experimental local information and joint action committees (circular of July 12, 2002), - Publish (via Internet) the new operating authorisation orders accompanied with the inspection reports. The scenario of detonation had not been selected in the risk analysis of the plant either by the operator, the inspectorate or by third experts, because the existing feedback led to consider as unlikely the detonation of ammonium nitrate when compliant with manufacturing standarThis disaster clearly shows that the contingency plans must consider a series of scenarios of the type, severity and kinetics representative of possible accidents even if their probability is considered extremely low. The method for evaluating the risk proved to be insufficient. The danger study must consider the danger potential of installations, examine possible scenarios and their consequences including the most dramatic or improbable, estimate probabilities and characterize the modes of occurrence. Reducing risks at the source must aim at reducing the potential for danger, the probability of accidents occurring and limiting the consequences through appropriate organisational and technical systems. The legal system did not enable sufficient control in terms of urban planning, particularly for the existing industrial sites whose surrounding area had already been urbanised.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Following the reaction, the entire vicinity was sealed off over a wide area and an investigation conducted while applying appropriate protective measures (armoured vehicle, protective clothing, drone flight). In consultation with the police, the danger zone was delimited and eventually all areas made safe to enter.
The plant’s fire service and the regular fire service, in cooperation with the police, sealed off and secured the area and provided fire protection.
The plant’s fire service extinguished wildfires in the immediate vicinity.
On the day of the accident, initially all operations were stopped completely. The early shift was stood down; the late shift resumed operations.
The affected area is situated on premises protected by a double fence and under electronic surveillance. No further precautionary action was required.
The area outside the operational area was initially secured by the police. Following the inspection, this area was deemed safe to enter and re-opened.
In consultation with the police, on the day of the accident the area surrounding the storage building was cleared of recoverable materials, particularly intact packaging, but also significant quantities of exposed propellant charges and other components. The material was secured for further investigations.


A decision on reconstruction is pending.
Sheeting etc. was used to protect glass breakages. Repairs were carried out by specialist firms.
Glass breakages reported by nearby residents will be reimbursed.
Damage to buildings was assessed by construction engineers.


Ejected material was salvaged and collected.
The site was explored and assessed for soil contamination.
An evacuation plan was drawn up and adapted.

Company staff immediately checked the functioning and condition of electrical equipment in all storage buildings.
No defects were identified.


All storage buildings had their electrical equipment checked by an expert in electrical engineering, lightning protection and building code law. No defects were identified.


After an initial tour of the accident site to assess the buildings, all other storage buildings are now undergoing structural surveys. An initial on-site response verified the structures and, in particular, function of the decompression areas. The report is pending.


Technical possibilities are being examined for enabling similar incidents to be detected in advance. As conventional fire detection technology cannot be used due to the material properties and dynamics of the process, permanent monitoring of the internal chamber is being tested. The use of thermography or thermal imaging cameras has had to be abandoned in the meantime. Plans for remote optical and electronic monitoring are currently being developed.


Analytical checks on the samples recovered after the incident and corresponding comparative samples revealed no signs of instability or other anomalies. However, the storage period is seen as an influencing factor. Plans for the analytical/chemical monitoring of stock are therefore being drawn up as a potential means of addressing the root cause. In addition, computerised processes have been introduced to facilitate stock control and disposal.
In this context, extensive re-evaluations have already been carried out and large quantities of stock transferred for disposal.


The key factor in the scenario considered here is the combining of nitrocellulose, a material capable of spontaneous combustion, with gunpowder, a thermal material in which a quasi-detonative reaction can be induced. In future, material capable of spontaneous combustion (e.g. nitrocellulose), particularly if it is not used in construction, will be separated from material in which thermal excitation can cause a very rapid deflagration or even a detonative reaction within the meaning of storage category 1.1 (mass detonation). In the case of materials used in construction, a decision should be taken on a case-by-case basis according to the revised storage category and the item’s properties. Appropriate assessments and relocation on site have already been carried out.

On-site:

Primarily, the impact can be limited by adapting storage quantities to the local conditions. These are based on the legal requirements for protection and safety distances and will be complied with. There will be a periodic review as part of the updating of safety analysis and safety reporting in accordance with the Störfallverordnung, the mechanism under German law for regulating incidents.
Glass breakages on site premises will be further reduced by applying protective film to panes, preventing possible injuries to staff.
The construction of additional earth banks or protective walls was examined but does not seem appropriate in the current situation.

Off-site:

When the deflagration occurred in the storage building, smaller, relatively lightweight projection hazards (cardboard, sheeting, etc.) were thrown over the fence up to around 20&amp;nbsp;m into the adjacent forest area. The trees between the warehouse and the fence had been thinned out due to parasite infestation. New planting took place.
In order to be able to further exclude risks to third parties, negotiations began on the purchase of the adjacent forest area to the south. A land-swap agreement is now in place. Formal implementation is pending. The area will be enclosed and the forest path running through it moved.

This rinsing water was also discharged into the tank via the waste water pit and retained.Sodium hypochlorite (chlorine bleach solution) was added to the waste water tank to destroy the hydrazine. The hydrazine was thus oxidised to nitrogen and the chlorine contained in the sodium hypochlorite was converted into chloride.By the time the maximum fill level was reached, we were able to reduce the hydrazine concentration to about 0.5%.

Until the cause of the explosion is determined and what caused any loss of containment of fuel, it is not possible to make definitive recommendations to ensure and improve safety in the future at this or similar depots. About 2000 people were evacuated. Sections of the M1 motorway were closed.This particular depot will be out of commission for many months. For other similar depots the Competent Authority has issued a Safety Alert to operators and is undertaking a series of inspections to ensure that preventative measures meet current standards.Early indications are that some product, water and foam flowed off site.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Fires in turbine oil systems, whether in steam or in gas turbine plants, frequently occur and often result in high levels of material damage. The combination of turbine oil, which is essential for the lubrication of the turbine bearings, and very hot surfaces in the immediate vicinity may result in a fire in the event of an – ultimately sometimes unavoidable – leak.The likelihood of a turbine oil fire such as this can be reduced by a combination of the following precautions and measures:The particular and rare combination of an ammonia-cooling plant with a steam turbine drive gives rise to fire hazards which are not covered by TRAS&amp;nbsp;110 (Technische Regeln für Anlagensicherheit – technical rules for plant safety). Additional fire protection requirements therefore have to be met.
In the hazard analysis for ‘external leakage’, the possibility of the leaked turbine oil igniting on contact with the hot surfaces of the steam turbine must be considered and the following countermeasures laid down:

Turbine oil leakage monitoring systemsThese consist, for example, of a continuous check of the level of oil in the oil container and monitoring of any rapid reduction of the level.In addition, collection trays in the area of the oil pumps and turbines, for example, might be fitted with leak monitoring (level detection switches).
Fire protection switchesFire protection switches should be installed in the central control room, in the area of the steam turbine and along the escape routes. When activated, these trigger the rapid shutdown of the turbine and switch off all auxiliary oil pumps once the turbine has stopped operating.
Constructive fire prevention measuresThe turbine oil systems – in particular the main oil filter and the control oil filter which caused this incident – must, as far as possible, be located separately from the steam turbine.Steam pipes must be carefully insulated and cladded.It should be checked whether the building’s retention of substances hazardous to water can be designed in such a way that if there is burning turbine oil, it does not result in under-burning of the steam turbine or plant components which carry ammonia.
Fine spray extinguishing systemAccording to the literature [HDI&amp;nbsp;2016], stationary spray extinguishing systems have proved successful in the case of turbine oil fires in steam turbines. In such systems, the turbine, the oil container and the other oil-carrying parts are provided with a large number of fine spray nozzles which spray water when triggered by an automatic fire detection system (UV detection, heat and smoke detection and in some cases multi-criteria detectors).The advantages of these spray extinguishing systems are the comparatively small quantities of firefighting water and the uniform distribution over the plant to be protected.

The lessons learned from this accident are as follows:- Acceptance testing by an expert represents a snapshot of the prevailing condition of the facility at the time of testing. If changes are made to the facility, in particular to safety-related equipment, conditions for safe operation can no longer be assumed in principle.- The investigation revealed that the facility was put into operation without the deficiencies, in particular the capacity monitoring, having been rectified as required by the expert. The competent authority was only belatedly made aware of this situation. The inspection report was not promptly forwarded to the authority. It is therefore advisable to establish enforceable written standards for acceptance testing by an expert in accordance with Section&amp;nbsp;29a, as well as for follow-up inspections, deadlines and forwarding inspection results to the authorities. These standards should support and facilitate monitoring.- Biogas facility operators often rely on assistance from contractors, as they themselves do not have the requisite skills. A strong emphasis must be placed on the credentials of outside companies. It is important to document the work done and to hand over the documentation once work is complete, so that each operator is aware of potential errors and the necessary follow-up measures, including inspections.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The internal emergency teams intervened very quickly and started to fight the fire which broke out after the explosion. The external emergency services arrived very quickly on the scene. Set up of a post-accident crisis unit comprising the fire brigade, the police, the municipality, the Governor, civil protection, a communication unit and the competent Seveso inspection services (FPS [Federal Public Service] Economy, RAM [Major Accident Risk] cell of SPW [Service Public de Wallonie]). Clean-up work and site security operations were organised in cooperation with a French company specialised in decommissioning and dismantling pyrotechnic facilities. The situation immediately after the accident may be described as follows. - According to estimates, there were still 6 tonnes of nitrocellulose granules in the building, partially spread on the ground, plus 18 tonnes in the vertical tanks, in the pit or trapped in the piping. - On the ground floor of the building, parts of the floor were covered with nitrocellulose granules mixed with a great deal of debris and rubble. - The building had been severely damaged: only the metal structure remained and this was in very poor condition. - In the event of the remaining nitrocellulose exploding, the effects could extend beyond the site and affect people living in the neighbourhood. The following urgent action was taken: - Saturating with water (drenching) was recommended, considering the fire risk - and even explosion risk - on account of the powder remaining on the ground and in the atmosphere. To that end, an internal fire team attended continuously for 8 weeks to ensure watering. - In agreement with the authorities, a site clearance procedure has been established: Stage 1: reducing the quantity of powder spilt and hence limit the likelihood of its reacting by: - continuous daily hosing of the powder on the ground; - filling the vertical tanks with water; - monitoring of water levels; - isolation of all networks into and out of the building (overhead and underground). Stage 2: Organise the manual collection and packing of the powder spread on the ground. This has been a very gradual operation, organised per areas of a few square metres following risk assessments based on photos of the areas in question and subject to work permits. The powder is recovered using an aluminium shovel and water-filled containers. Stage 3: Securing of walls and building framework at risk of falling before further work on site. Stage 4: Drainage of tanks. Stage 5: Treatment of pipes containing powder. Stage 6: Collection of remaining waste on the ground. Stage 7: Dismantling of the building. After obtaining a technical opinion from external experts, and in agreement with the authorities, a 350 m security perimeter was set up. Local residents were evacuated during the clearing and cleaning of the industrial site commencing at noon on 13 March, 6 days after the explosion. After one week, the security perimeter could be reduced as the risk of explosion could be ruled out thanks to the safety measures put in place. Site clearing and remediation works are still ongoing three months after the explosion.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The investigation has not yet been finalised and the causes have not been fully identified. Lessons and immediate steps: Replacement of the company's electrical centrifugal pumps (40 in total) with Venturi-type pumps. Venturi pumps operate on the principle of aspiration of the fluid to be conveyed by means of negative pressure brought about by the movement of a motive fluid (water). This type of pump means that friction can be reduced and the product conveyed can be kept wet continuously since the motive fluid is water. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Emergency measures - Remarks: When the accident occurred it was Sunday and the plant was stopped from 12 of Saturday. In the establishment there were only the guardian personnel formed by the guardian (also part of the IEP staff) and his family (2 persons). Outside the establishment there was a person for the grass cut (fire prevention).The establishment guardian (as part of the IEP staff) gave the alarm after the explosions, advising the internal emergency group and the Fire Brigades of Bologna, they extinguished the fire hotbeds and under the coordination of the internal emergency committee coordinator they did an inspection to verify probably dangerous situations.
In the establishment arrived also:
the Prefect and the Magistrate of Bologna, the majors of Castenaso and Bologna, the Regional Environmental Agency, the Local Sanitary Agency, the Carabineers of Castenaso and the artificer of the Bologna Police.
After an inspection of an expert the magistrature closed the plant, some days later the plant was opened except for the interested area and the impossibility of intervention on the risk ponits ( 2 loaded dryers, the storage deposit of cellulose nitrate and a bury tank with about 20.000 lt of solvents (50.000 lt of capacity).
Weeks later the dryers were emptied and the explosives stored in the deposits, then the deposit of the the cellulose nitrate was emptied and also the solvent tank (properly drained).
After the reclamation the processing of the semi-finished was ended till the final product to be stored.
The operation of put on safety condition the establishment, powder production is still stopped.
The monitoring points of the urban traffic do not observe significant change on the polluting agents in reference to the usual condition.
Subsequently the Regional Environmental Agency of Emilia Romagna did some sampling to verify the presence of amiantus fiber (some destroyed buildings were covered by amiantus), but the result was negative.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Before the accident the
establishment presented the SR and the Regional Technical Committee
evaluate it negatively, asking for integration. This SR didn't have the
risk analysis so there weren't accidental scenarios, the probable
occurrences and the effects.
The IEP was presented.
Moreover the establishment presented the Information Sheet even if it
wasn't exhaustive. </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The competent authority's recommendations for the operator:

Installation of gantry cranes on the roofs of LNG storage tanks: with the assurance of design and construction solutions, taking into account extreme weather conditions, guaranteeing a high level of safety;
Conducting systematic inspections of installations ensuring its maintenance in a proper technical condition, guaranteeing its safe operation and update the instructions and procedures for inspections and maintenance of installations to ensure that defects and faults can be identified at an early stage and corrective action taken.

Morover the competent authority obliged the operator to:

Perform detailed analysis of the impact of atmospheric factors (strong winds, other extreme weather events) on the entire infrastructure of the LNG Terminal;
Include the results of the above analysis in the safety report in a way that allows assessing their impact on the risk of a major accident.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">At 23:00 the operator of the complex's final effluent treatment plant channelled the effluents, which had been pre-skimmed in the settling tanks, into the overflow basin. The overflow ceased at 23:30.
At 03:45, the operator ordered the pits to be covered with foam in order to limit the evaporation of benzene, because the VOC detectors of the local monitoring network had measured for one hour and 15 min concentrations of benzene exceeding the threshold for informing the local municipalities (0.325 mg/m3 for two consecutive fifteen-minute periods), with spikes exceeding the threshold of 1 mg/m3 being measured at 02:00. However, the foam layer could not be put in place in the processing plant, whose basins have moving skimmers.
On the next morning, the operator started to empty the contaminated pits and spread sand on the connecting channel in order to absorb the benzene, which was then recovered and stored in drums. The hydrocarbon separation pits and the processing plant's storm water basin were also emptied, recovering 50 m3 of contaminated water, containing about 10 tonnes of benzene. The pumping operations ended four days later.
As soon as the warning threshold for atmospheric benzene was surpassed, faxes were sent to the nearby municipalities. The operator issued a press release on the morning of the second day and in the afternoon informed the municipalities that the accident had ended.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Lessons learned:

All process hazards, including all possible dangerous interactions between chemicals, should be identified.
Risk studies on batch processes should consider all process steps and conditions.
Measures eliminating the existence of an explosive atmosphere should always have priority to measures preventing the ignition of that atmosphere.
Loading of products through an open manhole into flammable atmosphere is not good practice.
Recommendations of risk studies and incident investigations need to be followed up systematically.
The safety responsibilities and duties of management should be clearly identified.
Work instructions should be clear and periodically reviewed and actualised.
The process control system should correspond to the intended process method.
All changes to the process and process working methods should be evaluated as to their impact on safety (management of change procedure).
The management of change procedure should also address changes in organisational structure or in staff.

Actions taken/imposed:

The lean air project was implemented before restart up of the production lines. Other processes involving opening of manholes where identified and were only accepted to start up again if no flammable substances were involved.
Raw materials are added via closed systems.
Buckets are replaced by closed recipients.
All process risk studies will be revised and completed within a short time period. Priorities for the risk analysis program were made based on hazard potential of the processes involved.
The adaption process of the safety management system to the guidelines of the new group is accelerated and expected to be complete before the end of 2006, correcting at the same time the shortcomings identified in the accident investigation.
Management will be instructed on safety responsibilities and duties.

The sound operation of this system has been incorporated into a check procedure prior to discharge;3- correctly sized orifice plates to be fitted into the vent lines to prevent the over-pressurization of the absorption columns should the vent valves be wrongly open or opened.When the Original Report was prepared also the following actions were to be evaluated:4- the provision of a liquid gas separator on the vent line (a suggestion from the recommendation contained in draft "Safety advice for bulk chlorine installations"). The separator is to be fitted with a temperature alarm which could then be connected to an automatic isolation valve;5- the provision of a logic interlock system to automatically control the complete discharge (this system built in fail-safe devices in the event of failure).The company decided to engage Courtaulds Engineering ltd bringing forward their hazard operability study for their "safety case" and the whole of the plant had to be thoroughly investigated.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The fire brigade reached the accident site and brought the fire under control in 45 minutes. Traffic circulation was interrupted for a few minutes on the nearby main road. Following the proposal of the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) the Prefect issued an urgent decree&amp;nbsp; defining the conditions for restarting operations as follows:-&amp;nbsp; investigation into the causes and the exact circumstances of the accident;- definition of the measures to be taken in order to prevent recurrence of such an accident;- safety assessment of the storage installation and also of neighbouring installations</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The following measures were implemented by the operator in order to avoid the recurrence of the accident.- changes in the procedures concerning operations inside hydrocarbon tanks:- definition of specific procedures for the site and the tanks ( not all tanks are identically equipped, thus precautionary measures have to be adapted to each tank)- cleaning/degassing operations to be performed only after validation (authorisation) by a site manager or his assistant.- ensure vapour concentration is below thresholds specified in the operational procedures (for explosive atmospheres) before starting any kind of operation inside a tank (mandatory)- improve ventilation by opening all tank outlets, removing valves and opening all manholes - maintain forced ventilation throughout the duration of the works- remind&amp;nbsp; external companies (subcontractors) performing maintenance operations on the tanks of operational proceduresFollowing the accident a French professional association within the oil industry created a think tank in order to&amp;nbsp; improve some of the&amp;nbsp; rules regulating the field. Some of these rules concerning the degassing of closed floating roof tanks are listed below.- extraction of vapours at the tank bottom and if needed use of forced ventilation- at least two complete air exchanges per hour and injection speed higher than 20 m/s&amp;nbsp; - the equipment used has to be fed with compressed air, be with casings and equipped with a shunt and/or an equipotential connection to the tank structure- opening of the fixed roof and the floating roof- work authorised with breathing apparatus when the LEL % falls below 10- explosion hazard measurement points to be chosen carefully (30 cm above sludge (deposits) and far away from manholes). </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

At 9:10 am, after receiving the incident report, the government of Hongshan District immediately started the contingency plan, and leaders of municipal and district governments and related departments hurried to the incident site to command emergency response efforts. Local police closed off and controlled the incident site. The local firefighters used water to cool and dilute the leaking liquid ammonia to reduce the volatilization of ammonia. At 9:10 am, safety supervision personnel arrived at the site, immediately co-working with the firefighters to evacuate the people at the accident site and photographing the site to obtain evidence. At about 10:15 am, the rescue workers shut the valve of the tank; around 10:20 am, the leakage source was completely cut off. About 1 hour and 30 minutes later, the on-site emergency response was basically completed. </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The metal tube had bad quality and it was aged. The company should have management procedures, regular inspections to identify and tackle ageing. Furthermore, inspection programme in place to check the quality of the pieces of equipment. The emergency cut off valve failed to work properly and therefore overload occurred. Secondary/additional safety barriers and written safety procedures should be in place to prevent overloading and being able to stop overloading of truck.

The competent authorities ordered evacuation for 24 hours of the establishments and of the private house as a preventive measure because of the uncertainty related to the still dangerous situation following the accident (uncertainties because of missing knowledge of type and number of substances stored in the plant and due to difficult assessment of the possibility of a further evolution of the accident on behalf of the emergency team). The competent authority (Procura della Repubblica di Crema) has put the plant under sequestration and started an official investigation.Official action taken - legal action: The plant is under a status of sequestration by the competent local authority, which imposed an official investigation in order to determine the causes of the accident and the eventual responsibilities.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: As known on the basis of an on-spot-investigation, the company had not presented the declaration foreseen by the Italian legislation corresponding to the Seveso Directive 82/501/EEC. The reason of the missed submission was in the discrepancy between the amount of the substances present in the establishment and the amount foreseen by the declaration obligation. The consequences of the accident should have been more serious if the splinters had hit places frequented by more persons or if they had reached the tank trucks or other equipments in the nearby establishment which treats chemical products. Considering the fact that the destillation products present in the warehouse were highly flammable, the actual consequences have been less serious than those principally possible. In the light of the above considerations it is useful to study again the problems which could be present in the case of runaway reactions and the limits that are foreseen by the Directive for flammable substances should be studied, particularly in cases in which establishments are not isolated.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Before the company resumes its activitites, it has to consult with the competent authorities to demonstrate that sufficient action has been taken to prevent recurrence.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The company had submitted its
notification only a few days before the explosion. The safety
organisation has not been evaluated as a whole during the
investigation. Interview with the truck driver indicates that he
followed the specified procedure for loading the tank, except for not
flushing the vapour return system. Evaluation of the specified
procedure for loading shows that the instructions are not very
detailed. It is possible that the pumps were not sufficiently cooled
before the filling procedure started. Furthermore, instruction to truck
drivers is given only once. As the working instructions are not
sufficiently detailed, variations in the way procedures are being
followed are possible. During training not all dangers of nitrous oxide
were taken into account. The possibility of explosive decomposition of
nitrous oxide is not mentioned on the safety information sheet.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

They had previously conducted a gap analysis against the accepted industry guidance on the storage of aerosols in warehouses and found themselves broadly compliant. Whilst further risk reduction measures had been identified including caging of aerosols and fitting of a deluge system they had been rejected following a cost benefit analysis. They had however decided to replace their FLTs with ones rated for use in a zoned area when the time came to renew their FLT fleet, which had been planned for a future date. The speed with which the incident escalated was not previously foreseen which highlighted the importance to consider additional control measures in any situation where rapid escape may be difficult e.g. working in raised platforms, scissor lifts, man aloft FLTs etc. This is now reflected in the associated trade industry guidance.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

An exclusion zone was set up to prevent ignition of the flammable vapour from the surface of the tank and exposure to toxic substances in naptha. However, foam application was stopped due to concerns about it causing static ignition. The Incident Management Team decided that the safest option to prevent fire was to remove gasoline by displacement with water through the roof drain to another tank. In all 1349 tonnes were recovered without injury to persons on site and contaminated water and hydrocarbon is being treated prior to disposal. Allowing the foam blanket to disperse resulted in significant evaporative losses to atmosphere of 4564 tonnes. This is in excess of the reportable quantity of 5% of the top tier threshold for gasolines and naphthas of 25000 tonnes namely 1250 tonnes (COMAH Schedule 1 Part 2).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The company considered the design code of t453 and the specific gravity of product &lt; 0.6, they identified other tanks under similar duty. Prioir to failure they had exceptionally high localised rain fall (42mm) and considered the design of the roof drains in relation to removing water from the roof.  the drain ran diagonally from the roof to the bottom of the tank they looked at how the weight of water filling the drain could potentially drag the roof down,  they found no evidence to support this hypothesis. They discussed the dismantling of the tank, considering the roof was deformed and their concerns re: unzipping of the tank - Petroineos contracted Das Fleet (a dutch demolition company with experience of this type of work) Outcomes of their inspection of the damaged tank were that it was likely a combination of multiple causes all contributing to the partial collapse of the roof: Likely Scenarios: Crease in roof was 1m in depth24hrs prior to failure 42mm of rain fell they considered drain restriction as above - however when tested the non return drain valve was functioning as designed. no obvious damage to roof drain, at time of incident the roof drain was free running, Drain size for the service was also considered - Petroineos stated that there was no reason to assume the drain was inadequately sized. Roof drain design: roof drain runs inside of tank as the tank roof lists the angle of the drain pipe is changed leading to the drain being compromised and unable to drainwater from the roof effectively potentially leading to rainwater/product building up on roof increasing the roof loading and potentially contributing to the roof sinking through loss of bouancy.Petroineos stated that there was no evidence for this under normal operation. Build up of product?No evidence of the roof material being penetrated. the roof was designed and manufactured by Motherwell Bridge circa 1960s to the standard in force at that time. All future refurb will be taken in line with current standards. Tank 453 was originally on Benzine duty (sg:0.6)  the tank functioned as designed on this service for 30-40 years without incident. Petroineos considered other tanks on their site under similar duty (1950s/60s design originally on higher s.g product then changing to lower s.g product) no issues on any other tank were found. No product placed in the tank was above normal operating temperatures, (stabalised gasoline is lighter and flashes off vapour at a higher rate when heated) There was no evidence of this. Roof Distorted/Tipped? Vapour lock? can't be ruled out, but no evidence to support this. Petroineos stated: not a credible scenario as temperature of product was not above normal operating tolerances.Roof Jamming - no evidence of this.Overplating of roof at area which failed? - they discovered 30 plus tonne of metal plating on the area that failed -  no evidence that roof was not performing within normal operating thresholds.. No wind loading Pontoon ring - not stiff enough? Petroineos stated that they had not been able to confirm details with regards to significant flexion of roof - however, they did not model for this. Age profile of roof: not a contributing factor; Going forward Training for individuals who inspect water levels on tank roof, the tank roof is esigned to withstand 10" of standing water on the roof with product at a s.g of 0.7.   they have not calculated failure modes to identify max rain water on tank roof holding stab gas at sg 0.6. Roof design - discussion being held with management on current design standards, standard inspections and bouancy checks being introduced to training sessions. Maintenance - WSE being revised, integrity of pontoons (inspection of pontoon holes to be completed by end of year) Management of change - operating envelopes now in place, ops team to identify any changes: operational checks;visual inspection;Identify abnormal conditions;Training for ops Overall:Company has not been able to identify one significant contributing factor leading to failure, they consider that the swiss cheese model of multiple contributing failure modes maybe the most credible/likely scenario. they state that they have learned valuable lessons around maintenance and reviewing the integrity of their tanks.    </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

However, at the climax of the fire large water delivery rates were employed (of the order of 2300 m3/h, with a pressure of 7 to 8 bar, supplied by the extinguishing system of the installation).Following the accident, an decree for urgent measures has been issued by the Departement's prefect, on 4 September 2000, requiring the operator to:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *&amp;nbsp; provide a list of the equipment affected by the accident,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *&amp;nbsp; provide an accident report including a report on measures for preventing recurrence of similar accidents,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *&amp;nbsp; provide a report on the operational status of the equipment .The same decree states also that the start-up of the installations involved in the accident has to be authorised by the regional prefect. During the discussions which followed, the following requirements emerged:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * evaluation of the operator's accident report by a third-party expert,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * implementation of a systematic and methodical inspection program, in order to assess the state of the equipment.After an examination of the neighbouring installations, the operator declared that only the "No. 7 cracking" unit had been significantly affected.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The following method has been chosen to assess the state of the equipment involved:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * As a first step, a (methodical and systematic) inspection plan has been prepared. This inspection plan has been approved by the expert who in this context was employed also by the insurance companies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * This inspection plan has been implemented for the totality of the equipment which may have been affected by the accident;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * The implementation of this inspection plan has made it possible to prepare a&amp;nbsp; classification of the equipment according to its operability.Taking in&amp;nbsp; consideration the elements mentioned above, the inspectorate has recorded the classification, as submitted by mail, which was obtained by each piece of equipment after implementation of this inspection plan; the inspectorate also reminded the operator that the various construction and repair operations involving the equipment must be carried out in compliance of the rules of good practice and while strictly complying with the relevant regulations.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The following corrective measures have been proposed by the operator: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *Change of pump type and modification of the vertical alignement of the column, in order to avoid cavitation phenomena;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Replacement of the motor-driven valves placed in the pipes feeding the P3A and P3B pumps, in order to reduce the shutting delay, the declared objective of Total being a shut-off delay below 30s;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Modification of the turbine's speed regulation system into an "isochronous" regulation system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Replacement of the 3/4 inch tapping (connection)&amp;nbsp; of the involved pumps by 1 inch tapping&amp;nbsp; (connection), provided with reinforcement gussets.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Modification of the drainage system of the turbines involved;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Implementation of a campaign aiming to increase worker's awareness of the importance of a strict application of operating procedures during the heat-up phase of turbines.These proposals were approved by the third-party expert, who has independently prepared some additional recommendations.With reference to these different expert assessments, the Departement's prefect has authorised the new start-up of the unit, the authorisation being subject to the condition of the operator's compliance with additional requirements (complementary decree of 27 March 2001).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A safety alarm installed in the facility went off at 13.12 (giving a reading of 105 ppm of HCl). The automated system shut down the facility and set off a local audible and visual alarm, while alarm warnings were appearing on the screens in the control room. The internal emergency plan was activated at 13.35, and the 35 employees were evacuated. The internal fire team, supported by 40 external fire fighters, equipped themselves with breathing apparatus and plugged the leak; the cloud of HCl was overcome using 4 lateral fire hose lines. The 120 m³ of water used was collected in a retention basin to be re-used in production. The internal emergency plan was lifted at 16.15. The next day, a specialised company pumped the 800 l (1200 kg) of spilled sulphur dichloride into the retention tank and then transferred to a storage vat. The HCl remained confined in the building. The retention basins were cleaned using a neutralising mixture (water + potassium carbonate), which was then pumped to the factory's treatment plant, where it was treated. A comparable accident took place at the site in 2006 (ARIA 31691). http://www.aria.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/accident/31691_en/?lang=en</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">From ARIA 31691
The accident, which occurred in an installation that had not been examined during the danger study, brought the following points to light: -the importance of detecting, controlling and assessing the consequences of changes in the nature of stabilisers and other additives added to dangerous raw materials (sulphur dichloride) by suppliers. These modifications may be a source of triggering events (crystallisation and clogging in this case) and increased risk; -Even if events that seem insignificant in the smoot
h running of the process such as the presence of glass debris from the lining of the distillation column coupled with the lack of a maintenance program on the production equipment (cleaning of the boiler) or safety equipment (clogging of the pressure sensor) do not directly lead to accidents, can have a considerable impact on the safety in downgraded modes; -a routine, unusual or exceptional maintenance operation (replacement of a pressure sensor) must be subject to a complete prior risk analysis, in order to avoid creating conditions which could lead to an accident or aggravate the initial consequences. In case of dangerous substances, these operations must be monitored and re-evaluated according to the hazards of the intervention; -the relative efficiency and the reliability of the procedures and more generally, organisational barriers (lock-out/lock-out removal); -a control system (steam valve) for a process can in no way be considered a safety system and cannot be retained as such. In particular, the production PLCs follow logic and criteria which the intervention teams are not fully aware of and which do not necessarily take the downgraded modes and lock-out situations into account. -the importance of installation design as early as the design phase (glass/metal interface); -the importance of risk analysis and failure modes, as well as technical and organisational barriers, with maximum details, for the various "operating" modes.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Following the call to the emergency services registered at 10.51 a.m., the fire brigade, ambulance service and police came to the scene immediately, given their distance from the plant. The authorities intervening at the scene notified the prefecture and judiciary by telephone. Following the security check of the area affected by the event, the Agency department responsible for safety at work intervened. The internal emergency procedure had not been triggered as, when the event occurred, the only employees in the factory were the two individuals involved in the event.The effects of the accident were essentially confined to the areas inside the factory (the part of the mixer drum thrown outside the factory perimeter by the blast did not cause any injuries or accidents). The administrations involved, working together with the Prefecture, set up two of the five road blocks provided for in the external emergency plan (EEP) to ensure access for emergency vehicles. An air ambulance was used to transport the injured workers to hospital, as they required treatment at a major burns unit.
The technical assistance consisted mainly of extinguishing the outbreaks of fire on the wooden structure of the destroyed roof and the remains of the clothing the workers had left on the spot immediately after the explosion. Fire extinguishing and safety checking operations were completed at around 14.05. Then until approximately 16.05, members of the fire brigade and state police established a perimeter around the area affected for the start of the police investigation.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It should be noted that the event occurred in a part of the plant in which the operator, according to the assessments included in the ‘Information sheet for the general public and workers on the risks of a major accident’, had not anticipated any problems. It should further be noted that the substance processed in the area where the accident happened is not listed in Annex I to the Directive. The analysis of the information collected showed that the accident was possible and identifiable. In fact, explosions of combustible dust are events that have been widely studied and consequently the conditions in which they are liable occur have been officially identified. It is therefore possible to foresee the effects of a potential dust explosion and put specific measures in place to prevent both the formation of clouds of suspended dust particles, and the formation and presence of an active source of ignition. In the light of such considerations, work involving the use of combustible powders should have been included in the ‘Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents’. The only major accident risk envisaged in that report appears to be that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14 bar) at a distance of up to 173 m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07 bar) at up to 281 m and cause reversible injuries (0.03 bar) at up to 533 m.  The plant’s Safety Management System was reviewed in 2008, 2009 and 2011.
The 2011 review noted that the plant operator, in response to the irregularities detected previously in 2008 and 2009, drew up and established its own Safety Management System that was sufficient to meet the legal requirements. A subsequent on-the-spot check in 2013 showed that the latest instructions had been acted upon and that the operator had taken care to update the Internal Emergency Plan prompted by changes to the company’s organisation chart. The decision to merge the Safety Management System (SMS) (based on the previous technical legislation) with an Occupational health &amp;amp; safety management system (OHSMS) (based on international standard OHSAS 18001) clearly demonstrates the operator’s intention to implement an overall improvement of the Plan.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The unit was shut-down and fire protection teams were activated while the affected area was evacuated. The fire was not extinguished to avoid formation of an explosive gas cloud; at the same time the protection of structures exposed to intense heat radiation using cooling via fixed monitors and of the pyrolysis furnace by means of a fixed water curtain was necessary. Isolation valves around the unit on fire were closed to reduce the amount of flammable substances potentially involved. However, one of the isolation valves could not be completely closed (because the accident occurred during a test) and therefore the duration of the fire was prolonged. After 10 minutes other pipes were ruptured causing an escalation of the fire, which was finally extinguished after 13 hours (at about 00:45) by the plant&amp;nbsp; fire brigade (58 people).EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Activation of the External Emergency Plan. Population has been advised to stay indoors. Traffic in the national high-way No 73 and other roads of minor importance around the site were interrupted. These precautionary measures were taken up to 16:15.&amp;nbsp; SOLVAY personnel performed toxic gas measurements near the school C.E.S. in the city of Tavaux. Concentrations of about 10-15ppm of hydrogen chloride were measured and the school (50 pupils) was evacuated towards a school in Dole. Hydrogen chloride concentrations measured indicate that confinement should have been preferred versus the evacuation. Ambient air monitoring performed by the local mobile chemical emergency intervention unit could detect only traces of toxic gases. Used fire fighting water was collected for treatment at the waste-water treatment facilities of the plant.

Such ordinances oblige the ATOCHEM Company to:- carry on studies on the morphology and permeability of the clay stratum and on the flow behaviour of the superficial water-bearing stratum;- realize a mechanical barrage and a hydraulic barrage, with purifying system of the withdrawn water;- install some piezometer for the control of the first and the second water-bearing stratum;- study solutions to permit the oxidation on site. Moreover the mayor authorized the ATOCHEM to transfer the polluted water withdrawn from underground by the pumps of the hydraulic barrage (toxic waste) for their provisional storing nearby the "Italiana Petroli" company. The mayor authorized also the provisional storing nearby the ATOCHEM through the installation of a containment basin. He has obliged also the ATOCHEM to daily measure, by the piezometers, the concentration of acetone, free cyanides, total cyanides and ACH. Finally the mayor asked the ATOCHEM to give an exact evaluation of the released ACH. ATOCHEM has prepared a reclaim plan based on the prosecution of the ACH squeezingoperation from the water-bearing stratum and on the continuous water emission in the pouring point and in the well No.2, with squeezing in the downstream wells 9, 10 and 12, up to values near to 0. Analysis of the ground and following treatment of the same are foreseen. On February 28 1995 the mayor authorized the Elf ATOCHEM to reclaim the area, following its plan. He promoted a technical-scientific committee to direct the reclaim. The committee which is composed of technicians of the USLL 68 and 69 will give the results of his work(as soon as they will be available) to the European Commission.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

A sanitation firm was quickly on the site to start the clearing of the oil from the collapsed tank. To get at an overview of the accidnet they used a drone so that all invovled had the same view of the situation.&amp;nbsp;
It's important that the person that got hurt in the accident got a coarse cleaning-up before transported with the ambulance and also at the hospital so that the hospital's emergency doesn't get contaminated.&amp;nbsp;
It would have helped the emergency service if the environmental experts at the municipalty had planned duty outside office hours.&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The lessons learned can be divided into four main components: communication; practice; environment; and design, construction and control.
Communication
Communication to prevent an accident includes communication between builders of the concrete plate, the tank, the inspectors and the users. The importance for different branches to discuss the building, the controls, the use of the tanks. Those who build the foundation of the tank needs to exchange with those who build the tanks. Those who inspect the tanks need to discuss with the users so that it's clear what the limitations are with different measurements.
Communication when the accident occurs include for instance the importance of involve the communicators in the municipality to spread the information of the accident in different channels, media and also SMS.&amp;nbsp;The emergency service used a drone to get a better view of the accident and it’s also important that every involved has the same view of the situation. It’s also important that the emergency service has established routes of communication with the environmental experts in the municipality, even outside the office hours due to the importance of environmental aspects, both considered to the substances involved but also so that the emergency effort doesn’t worsen the (environmental) consequences.
Practice/exercise
It’s important that all of those who could be involved in an accident practice to better handle a real accident. It includes both the authorities and the Seveso establishment. To practice also lets the involved meet in person which shouldn’t be underestimated. It could make it easier to find and establish contact when an accident occur.
Design, construction and control of the equipment
The dialogue between the designer and builders of the tanks, the constructors of the foundation of the tank and those who control the tanks could be approved to assure that construction of the tank and its resistance to corrosion.
To get better feedback from the controllers of the tanks if there are any possible problem or indication of the tank tanks controlled.
Investigate if the prescribed interval of control of the tanks should change.
Environment
The emergency service had an established contact with a company that started clearing of oil early after the tank collapsed.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

An independent professional site compliance audit was beneficial because it identified further anomalies.Reliance on external contractors for all gas expertise is undesirable and is being rectified.Further measures:Non Australian Gas Association (AGA) approved solenoid valves were replaced with approved electro-hydraulic system. Preventative maintenance contracts were established for all Type B gas appliances – with 6 months and 2 years frequency. A missing audible ‘position proving alarm’ was installed, to detect valve position at burner shutdown. Although the original design was OGS approved with an alarm included, the ‘as built’ installation did not include the alarm. The installation contractors are no longer an operating business. Operating procedures instruct operators to close the appliance isolation valve manually whenever the gas burner is off line. The company decided that electrical/instrument technicians will all have Type B gas permits. A Type B compliance audit was conducted for all remaining gas burners to confirm their ‘as built’ compliance.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

And at 06.00 the public was warned by a message broadcast on the radio. This message informed the public that fuming sulphuric acid (oleum) from a dock cistern in Kemiras Kopparverk dock had come into contact with water and converted to gas, which in the south-westerly wind threatened all of Helsingborg's urban area. Later during the morning information was adjusted and stated that it was 96% sulphuric acid. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information on this serious situation.During the rest of the morning the cordoned off exclusion zone was reduced so as to cover an area of about 1 square kilometre. This area houses approximately 7,000 inhabitants and the civil protection measures being taken greatly reduced their freedom of movement. The exclusion zone was further reduced later during the day, but still affected some 4,500 inhabitants. On Sunday (6th February) at 1700 hours the Incident Commander in Helsingborg ordered a further reduction of the exclusion zone so that it now only covered the grounds of the affected company, KKAB, surrounding the incident site. The situation was assessed as extremely serious and the public were warned and advised to stay indoors and close all windows and doors. The public were also advised to listen to local radio on 103.2 Hz for continuous information on this serious incident. However, the warning to the public was delayed more than one hour after the incident occured.&amp;nbsp;The municipal fire brigade in Helsingborg was reinforced by fire brigades from 35 other municipalities and by the Chemical Emergency Support Unit in Skåne. Official Action taken - legal action:Preliminary police investigation was removed from the cause list.Official Action taken - other action:
The Swedish Accident Investigation Board has investigated the accident (Report RO 2008:02) and gave the following recommendations to the Swedish Rescue Services Board.1. Work for that the consequences of large amount of sulfuric acid is investigated and, if desirable, propose that the substance should be included in the list of dangerous chemicals in the Seveso Directive.2. Work for the awareness among pertinent companies and organizations of the risks involved with major emissions of sulphuric acid that mix with water containing chloride ions 3. Work for the awareness among municipal fire and rescue servicies and other pertinent authorities of the risks in cases of major emissions of sulphuric acid that mix with water containing chloride ions. 4.Work for the awareness of pertinent companies and organizations of the risk of a domino effect as a result of damages to underground pressurized conduits (pipes or cables) that are in dangerous proximity to tanks containing dangerous substances. 5.Clarify the nomenclature used in warning the general public so that the meaning of the "Important announcement" signal and warning information known as "Important&amp;nbsp; Public Announcement" can simply and clearly be distinguished from one another in connection with municipal fire and rescue services in cases where misunderstanding otherwise may may occur.6. Work for the immediate use of the "Important announcement" signal as well as the "Important Public Announcement" warning by municipal fire and rescue services in emergencies. 7. Work for a follow-up the management organisation of&amp;nbsp; the municipal fire and rescue services and their ability to effective&amp;nbsp; handle a major accident. The aim of the follow-up should be to work for a purposive organisation and for the planning of sufficient and appropriate resources. The Swedish Accident Investigation Board gave the following recommendations to the Swedish Work Environment Authority:1. Consider the need to complement ordinances in the Work Environment Authority's statutes regarding pressurized devices in terms of the background of , among other things, the need to assess risks and constantly supervise those facilities corresponding to major water pipes with significant pressure and flow. 2. Work for that equipments for warning for example&amp;nbsp; in-site sirenes have sufficient reliability.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The incident on 4th February 2005 has led to the initiation of a number of activities at KKAB, all of which have as their objective the prevention of a similar incident being repeated. Here is a description of current activities: 1. Immediately after the incident an inspection began of the whole of KKAB's industrial area, to assess if there were other important installations (from a safety perspective) in which a similar incident could occur.&amp;nbsp; With this as a basis, and in conjunction with the following points, the company will decide on the design of future water supply.2. As the other supply pipes for the coolant in the docks area could not be guaranteed to be in a satisfactory condition, especially as sulphuric acid had leaked into the pipes during the incident, the decision was promptly taken to lay new pipes. The new pipes are made of plastic, PEH 100, and lie overground along the shoreline in the docks area.&amp;nbsp; Risk analyses have been carried out and the new pipeline has been put in place. The company has also decided to build another pipeline parallel to the first.&amp;nbsp; The pipes will be covered by macadam.3. At the time of the incident the pressure in the coolant supply pipe fell from about 6 to about 2 bars. The operator's instructions then were to ensure continued coolant supply to the works, which is why another pump was started. Such a powerful drop in pressure probably indicates that something serious has happened with the pipe. Therefore, the new pipes are installed with a low pressure fail-safe, which shuts off the pumps if the pressure falls below a level lower than those expected within normal operating conditions.4. KKAB has started working out what guidelines should apply for ground pipes within the company's area. Choice of material, ground conditions, proximity to installations relying on pressure, dimension and protection measures taken are some of the parameters that will be taken into account. 5. The company has also started an overhaul of routines in order to increase focus on ground pipes. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Thus the accident scenarios were needed to recalculate in the event. The rescue services decided to evacuate all the inhabitants in the area before they attempted to move the container and cool down the interior. To safeguard all the inhabitants, the evacuation was extended to cover the whole Vihtavuori village, which has about 2000 inhabitants. After a successful rescue operation, the evacuation was completed during the same evening.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1. All parties need to ensure that they have adequate processes and procedures in place related to the handling, storage, transportation and disposal of emulsion explosives. They also need to ensure that these methods are properly implemented. 2. In major hazard installations everyone is responsible for safety and following instructions. Managers need to ensure that regulatory requirements are met and corrective actions are adequate.3. In particular, it is essential to observe how changes in performance affect safety. Safety-critical changes may include a significant and rapid increase in production volumes, the use of new technology or new kinds of products, or changes relating to organisational structures and responsibilities, or supply chains. There is a need to organise training for personnel and to improve instructions to better identify and manage the effect of these changes on safety.4. In addition, there is a need to organise training for personnel and improve instructions related to the identification and handling of safety-critical non-conformities.5. The major accident scenarios presented in safety reports should be more systematically communicated when preparing internal and external emergency plans. In addition, training for those scenarios should be comprehensive.6. A complete reform of the Explosives Act is called for. To this end, the requirements should be updated to take account of the specific properties and risks connected with emulsion explosives.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The dispatcher's coordinating doctor assigned 5 SMURD(Mobile Emergency, Resuscitation and Rescue Service) and 4 SAJ(County Ambulance Service) teams to the scene of the intervention. Measurements were made by the CBRN crew and it was found that there were no leaks of hazardous substances into the atmosphere.

This recovered 4.260 tonnes of solution, reducing the quantity lost to the river to 12.301 tonnes.Official action taken - other official action: A COMAH prohibition notice was issued by the competent authority, prohibiting use of the tank until repair was made to the satisfaction of the competent authority.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

In the initial phase (a few minutes), the shift supervisor and other operators from the unit and the laboratory came running from the upper floor and the ground floor having been attracted by the noise created by the event.
The laboratory operators carried out first aid.
One of the operators from the quality laboratory responsible for communication proceeded to make the emergency call (112), the call to the health and safety manager and, subsequently, to other members of the management team.
Two ambulances, the Carabinieri (police), the fire brigade, and a rapid response car from the local health authority thus attended the scene.
The seriously injured operator was taken to a specialist burns unit.
The other operator involved received hospital treatment and was then discharged.
Following the events, company staff completed the interrupted operations, with the approval of the authorities present, for the sole purpose of making the reactor safe.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The company acted quickly to implement and report, in its safety management system, a new version of the procedure for handling flammable substances, which is more explicit about chemical compatibility and earthing the system, and the proper identification of the specific equipment (BGB-ILS-008 rev. B of 16 September 2013, 'Handling and use of flammable raw materials H225 H226 — R10 and R11 in RS1').
The company is currently looking into a new, fixed filling system for flammable raw materials, in a closed cycle and/or a nitrogen atmosphere, from mobile containers, so as to rule out the possibility of inappropriate operations.
The Commission points out that the risk related to electrostatic charges when transferring products from small containers tends to be underestimated. In order to limit that risk, specific management measures are essential. It may also be worth considering using closed cycle transfer systems. It would be useful to look closely at these aspects in the context of assessments by the competent authorities and during inspections.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Due to the toxic risk, the solid phenol was chiselled out of the bund by staff in full personal protective equipment, in accordance with a detailed risk assessment and method statement. Special precautions were taken to avoid personal contamination when removing the protective equipment.The material removed was drummed to await safe disposal in accordance with waste disposal legislation.Official action taken - legal action: An Improvement Notice was issued: the investigation found that the operator had reviewed safety systems and had identified the shortcomings, but had not completed improvements to the phenol storage facility that would have prevented this accident. The safety system review found other shortcomings elsewhere on the plant so the Notice required a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.		Official action taken - other official action: Further inspection visits will be paid to ensure compliance with the action plan required by the Improvement Notice.
Discussion about response: The operator was responsive and concerned. However, this was the second incident within a year that had involved the mix of manual and automatic systems, indirect measurement of plant condition giving operators a false impression of plant status, and the lack of a system requiring operators to confirm that they have taken correct action. The operator had acknowledged these shortcomings and was addressing them when this incident occurred. However, there was still the lack of a site-wide strategy for improvements. An Improvement Notice was issued requiring a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the safety system review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Improvements to the phenol storage will include soft-wired alarms linked to the load cells to inform panel operators and to trip out the transfer pump at tank Hi-level. Float switch operated level sensors will be provided as part of a hard-wired interlock to the transfer pump, stopping pumping at Hi-hi level.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: The mix of automated and manual systems were
vulnerable to human error. There was not adequate confirmation of
correct actions.
The poor design of the level measurement system (by indirect means)
gave control panel operators, remote from the storage facility, a false
impression of the state of the plant.
Re-design of safety systems required with direct level measurement and
hard-wired interlocking to the transfer pump.
Measures to prevent recurrence: An Improvement Notice was issued as the investigation found that although the operator had reviewed safety systems and had identified the shortcomings, they had not completed improvements to the phenol storage facility that would have prevented this accident. The safety system review found other shortcomings elsewhere on the plant so the Notice required a detailed prioritised action plan to be developed building on the review and setting timescales for upgrades to all of the relevant plant safety systems.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Improvements to the phenol storage will include soft-wired alarms linked to the load cells to inform panel operators and to trip out the transfer pump at tank Hi-level.

Immediate measures:
Verification of the hydrochloric acid storage tank and the affected pipelines prior to recommissioning.
Introduction of the four-eyes principle.
Additional pH measurement before starting unloading and incorporation in the checklist.
Re-teaching the staff.
Calibration of the existing density meter.
Medium-term measures:
Carrying out a hazard analysis (eg HAZOP) for the chemical storage and storage in the storage tanks and implementation of emerging necessary measures.
For largely avoidance of human error, an inline measurement system should be installed for automatic clearance for the unloading process</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

A hundred samples&amp;nbsp; taken from soot, building elements, soil, water and vegetables proved the presence of dioxins and furanes. Decontamination was performed on the buildings and grounds of the plant and on 2 buildings located 250 m from the plant. A plan for eliminating PCB containing material is set up. The authorisation for the progressive start-up of the plant, 15 days after the accident, was issued by prefect basing on the documentation on the works performed and relating expert advice presented by the operator. Limitations concerning the off-site area were lifted after 25 days.Epidemiological monitoring during a year of the affected persons is foreseen.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The accident scenario "fire of a transformer" had not been considered in the safety report made in 1992, probably because this kind of material is present in many sites and thus it is someway a bit trivialised. Nevertheless these transformers are subject to risk prevention regulations concerning PCB.The lack of knowledge by the personnel concerning the precise characteristics of the transformers has delayed the assessment of the chemical risk by the emergency response service.Protection measures have been set up only belatedly. These measures have been taken only after the fire had been extinguished, in reason of the fact that the event was notified to the competent authorities only two hours after the fire had been put under control.In this kind of event, where the entire public service system is concerned by the response measures, it is essential to work in synergy. This allows to gain time and avoids to double efforts in the same research area.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The inappropriate operation of an installation must in principle be considered in a separate risk assessment, in this case, the emergency operation of the gas storage facility and its protection against explosions.The resulting findings and measures must be implemented and followed up by the operator. In this case, increased checks of the edges of the tank and the hose clamp had been laid down as a measure.However, these were obviously insufficient in this case, as regular manual gas measurements in the area of the tear and even a visual inspection of the membrane in the areas concerned were not possible.The only logical measure would have been to take the gas storage facility out of operation.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

After, the remaining contents of the heater was fed to a chlorine destruction unit.

A water screen was set up down wind from the plant by the company fire brigade (in cooperation with the municipal firebrigade).EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Supervisor activated phases 0 and 1 of emergency plan (warning of emergency services, i.e. municipal and other authorities). Several complaints (about 10) from the neighbourhood were recorded by the police which activated phase 2 of the emergency plan (annoyance, no danger). Measurements by the municipal/regional fire brigades were carried out outside the establishment but chlorine concentration in air was less than 0.2 ppm. Gradually, municipal fire brigade brought the alarm phase back to 1 and, then, to 0.

The day shift crew in the daylight discovered signs of EO leakage underneath a manifold, and discovered a blind flange that had not been discovered during the night. This obviously alerted senior management, and soon it was concluded that the entire transferred volume ( 32,5 tons) had found its way into cooling water discharge point via a Pressure Relief Valve. Immediately, the local emergency team was established and started the impact assessment. Simultaneously, local authorities as well as the AKZO Nobel Corporate Emergency response team were alerted, and a independent investigation of the incident by corporate and independent experts with support of the Board of Management was initiated.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The investigation team would like to stress that these observations are of great value, because they could influence a wide area of the organisation. During the investigation the following observations have been made.  During the investigation the team observed room for improvement in the field of housekeeping,  Examples being:  Absence of signage, welcoming documents and related instructions in the reception area in other than Swedish (i.e. in English)  A reasonable level of tidiness in the reception building with unfixed repairs waiting  In the plant:  Missing valve tags, obstacles on the plant floor that could/should have been removed previously, tools/instruments, hoses and other obstacles in installation landings  From a series of incidents including the subject one in Stenungsund it appears that alarm architecture and –management is an ongoing dilemma.  It would be worthwhile considering a review of Control Room Alarm Architecture comparing critical process conditions -as derived from risk analysis with the way the same conditions are presented in a(ny) control room in a distinctly differing format from status (change) information. Without such distinction, alarms threaten to become ‘information noise’ between (hundreds of) status notifications.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On-site: The evacuation alarm was automatically activated in the affected area. Evacuation of personnel was not necessary – this took place during the weekend and no staff or any other persons were present in the area. The danger zone was localised.Power to the installation was promptly shut off. The damaged area was cordoned off after the fire had been successfully extinguished.
Off-site: The fire brigade took air measurements around the location, testing for harmful substances (using a measuring equipment vehicle belonging to the Groß-Gerau central office). No harmful substances were detected (the measurement results are available in the on-site fire brigade area).In the area of a neighbouring settlement, a burnt smell could be detected, which was classified as non-harmful on the basis of the measurement results.Both the on-site fire brigade incident command and the management of the Rüsselsheim fire brigade determined that there was no detriment or danger to the public or to the surrounding neighbourhood. Therefore, no action was taken to alert the residents or the surrounding neighbourhood (for example using the hessenWARN app).
The damaged area was cordoned off. A cleaning company removed the accumulated quenching water by means of a vacuum vehicle and transferred it to wastewater engineering. Following a total loss, the installation is being stripped down by a specialist company.
There was no environmental damage.Checks on water channels were stepped up and incoming water was redirected to a retention pond. The measurement results were normal (no harmful airborne emissions).
The on-site fire brigade requested two firefighting units and the measuring equipment vehicle.In extinguishing the fire, the on-site fire brigade received support from the volunteer fire brigade.The measurements were carried out using the measuring equipment vehicle.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The Facility Management’s Medium Voltage Section checked all the medium-voltage stations on site for fire safety. Minor shortcomings were detected during the checks:

Fireproof bulkheads
Cable insulations.

All shortcomings were remedied immediately.There are a small number of oil-filled cable connectors, which are checked regularly.
Since the installation sustained a total loss, reconstruction is necessary.The new installation will include an integrated extinguishing system.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Repairs to the damaged areas began recently.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Additional checks on the electrical equipment in the room by a specialised firm. The equipment is to be reconstructed in accordance with a reconstruction plan drawn up by a specialised firm. This involves replacing the baths, which were hitherto excessively large, by smaller ones and relocating them where appropriate.The new fire alarm system has in the meantime been armed and, in the medium term, is also to be connected to the fire brigade.

The internal emergency plan is to be revised and updated to ensure that the operator’s reporting requirements are fulfilled.&amp;nbsp;
The electrical equipment in the whole plant is to be checked promptly by a suitably qualified employee. In addition, thermographic measurements are also to be taken.The implementation of the checks is to be documented.
All electrical and mechanical components that are liable to overheat in the event of a malfunction are to be checked regularly at intervals of no more than two months by means of thermographic measurements. The results are to be documented. This interval may be adjusted in response to the actual frequency of faults being detected.These checks are to be carried out systematically. The management system is to be updated accordingly. Operating procedures are to be drawn up or existing ones amended.
Across the whole site, any contaminated firefighting water in the event of an incident is to be contained safely using state of the art safety equipment. For this purpose, the operator is to check whether the firefighting water containment capacity available in the individual hall sections is sufficient. Where necessary, steps are to be taken to increase the firefighting water containment capacity.

In this context, attention should be paid to the following:

Measures to contain firefighting water are to be carried out in accordance with good engineering practice in safety matters.
All indoor pipes, such as rainwater pipes and other openings to the sewers, are to be protected up to the necessary damming level for firefighting water retention by fireproof bunding or protective tubes made from chemical-resistant, non-flammable materials so that in the event of a fire, firefighting water cannot flow unchecked into pipes or openings.


The pumps used are tools within the meaning of the Industrial Safety Ordinance, as the pump is an integral part of an electroplating system and is used to pump substances around that system.These tools are subject to damage from the atmosphere prevalent in the electroplating system and the substances to be pumped. To be used, they need to be operated, maintained, dismantled and monitored.The employer must assess the risk arising from the use of tools and take the appropriate safety measures accordingly. This also means taking into account the hazards arising from the use of the tool within the working environment. The manufacturer’s instructions on testing cycles, among other things, give rise to the following measures for testing tools:


The risk assessment pursuant to the Industrial Safety Ordinance should be revised and documented with regard to the issues raised above.
Measures arising from this are to be implemented.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: The Environment Agency National Action PlanIn the April 2001 report, the Agency detailed its National Action Plan for ensuring that the lessons learned from CSG Sandhurst are implemented across England and Wales. The plan covers seven key issues requiring review, these being:·Issue 1: Licensing arrangements at CSG Sandhurst·Issue 2: Licensing arrangements for chemical waste treatment and transfer facilitiesIssue 3: Emergency response arrangementsIssue 4: The balance of maintaining customer confidence in the licensing process and taking enforcement actionIssue 5: Officer awareness of Agency policy, procedures and practice on inspection and prosecutionIssue 6: Environmental policies and proceduresIssue 7: Health and Safety policy issuesSpecific actions are identified under each of the above issues, (21 in total), along with a manager responsible for taking the action forward and a target date for completion. HSE ActionsHSE paper has been presented to the Hazardous Installations Directorate (HID) (Land Division) Management Board on the lessons identified during the investigation of the CSG incident. The report identified issues in four key areas that have been acted upon, these being:·a) emergency response - substantial changes have been made to the Directorates emergency response arrangements.b) working with the Agency - HID have progressed common operating instructions and procedures when working with the Agency as the Competent Authority and specific arrangements have been made to work more closely where COMAH does not apply.c) prior regulation of the site - HID have reviewed the arrangements made for carrying out "prior role" enquiries and are about to produce additional guidance for staff.d) chemical waste treatment industry - a new joint inspection initiative involving the HSE and the Environment Agency was conducted in 2002 (see below).Joint Inspection InitiativeA joint HSE and Agency inspection/enforcement initiative was undertaken because of concerns that arose not only from this incident, but incidents at other such sites. The inspection initiative was necessary both to ensure that health, safety and environment provisions are complied with and to demonstrate better standards of control within the industry. The joint inspection initiative included:a) a seminar with representatives of the chemical waste treatment and storage industry.b) conducting inspections at waste treatment and transfer establishments.c) providing feedback to the chemical waste treatment and storage industry. The inspection initiative was formally launched at a seminar, held jointly by HSE and the Agency, on 14 May 2002 in Birmingham. The seminar was attended by about 50 representatives of the industry, including representatives from both large national companies and from small/medium enterprises. Senior HSE and Agency staff introduced the seminar, outlining issues of concern and the purpose and implementation of the inspection initiative.The seminar encouraged an open discussion with the industry that recognised the need to take action to ensure compliance and to improve the public perception of its activities. One of the outcomes was that the Agency, HSE and the industry will develop better communications and if necessary produce an industry code of practice to set standards for health and safety controls that are specific to this business. A report of the findings of the joint enforcement and inspection programme was published in February 2004.Useful References:"Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP into the major fire on 30 October 2000 at Cleansing Service Group Ltd, Upper Parting Works, Sandhurst Lane, Sandhurst, Gloucester GL2 9NQ"(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/csg1rept.htm)Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (April 2001)(http://www.hse.gov.uk/hid/sandhurst/sandhurst2.htm)Progress Report For The Deputy Prime Minister The Right Honourable John Prescott MP (July 2002)(http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_update_report_july_02.pdf)Final Report for Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Department for Works and Pensions (September 2003) (http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/commondata/acrobat/csg_sep_03._609513.pdf)HSL Work following the fire at CSG Ltd., Upper Parting Works, 30th October 2000, FR/01/08HSL Report on potential mechanism for fire propagation at CSGHazardous Waste Storage and Treatment Facilities 2002/2003.

The damaged film has already been replaced by the manufacturer and the gas storage membrane checked for damage. After the damage occurred, precautions were immediately taken to protect the weather protection film from further damage. This prevented the film from becoming detached and the loose film from causing subsequent damage. Following the storm, the weather protection film was fully removed from the substrate store and placed to the side of the plant to protect it from further damage.

Measures laid down for repairs:

Prerequisite for entry (inter alia): an erected crane with the means to accept passengers and a crane operator are available (secondary escape route/means of rescue for staff on the column if the way down is blocked).
Detailed instructions for opening manholes.
Detailed response to the risk of spontaneous ignition by means of various measures, including keeping the beds moist.
Plans for a gas monitoring system with remote monitoring for early detection of a fire.
Additional gas analysis as cross-check.
Temperature control in the column.
Provide a clear indication of the placing and securing of manhole lids 11, 8 and 5 so that, in the event of a fire, there is no leakage of firewater and fire-fighting is effective.
Instructions for fire-fighting in the event of failure of these measures.
Additional information on PPE (due to moistening, it is wet inside the column and it rains water contaminated with dirt and cleaning agents).

The implementation of the above measures, irrespective of the effectiveness of the additionally planned chemical treatment of iron sulfide, prevents spontaneous ignition and, in the event that ignition does take place, enables effective firefighting and thus ensures the protection of staff.
Measures to improve plant safety:

Ensure an appropriate risk assessment with the mapping of the appropriate mitigation measures.
Risk analysis documents are available throughout the refinery via a common database.
In order to address risks from pyrophoric substances, the safety measures under the Guideline for safety-critical organisational measures are to be identified and implemented without fail.
To further ensure that the procedures arising from the management system are properly implemented, there is a quality control through which the quality of risk analysis is verified by means of an audit programme. The auditors come from another part of the refinery.
In addition, a guide for chemical decontamination will be developed, which will also be discussed and communicated across companies in the refinery sector. One of the aims is to develop a checklist with appropriate measures to check the quality of decontamination.
A further aim is to increase the operator’s and industry’s knowledge of the basis and effect of this process, so that the competence of a service provider in relation to the whole process can be thoroughly assessed.
At the highest levels of the organisation, more emphasis is needed on cross-disciplinary thinking as part of the safety culture (‘away from narrow, silo-based thinking’) so that workflows can be understood and planned across the board.
Other organisational measures relate to deepening awareness of risk analysis among key staff, in particular the importance of prerequisites for mitigation measures (such as the fixing of important manholes) as well as better training on the rules for entering restricted spaces.


The extinguishing plan for fires inside the column has been adapted.
Improvements to damage limitation measures (secondary fire safety).

The off-site emergency plan was set off by the prefecture of Ancona. Concerning the off-site emergency plan it can be noted that its activation had mainly a precautionary purpose, because the impact area of the accident did not affect, according to evidence, either the railway line (during the first phase of the accident before train circulation had been stopped two trains had passed), or the Flaminia road adjacent to the establishment.As a precautionary measure the military authority ordered the evacuation of barracks located near the establishment.The roofs of tanks TK231 and TK232, affected by the fire, were kept safe under a protective layer of extinguishing foam deposited on top of the roofs after the fire had been extinguished Emergency measures - Remarks: Concerning the emergency measures taken off-site, the population was alerted (ref 7302) over a loudspeaker system, installed in adequate locations in the town of Falconara, by the municipality of Falconara in common agreement with the establishment specifically for emergencies occurring in the refinery.
The measures still necessary at the time of the inspection consisted substantially in maintaining a cover of extinguishing foam on the roofs of the storage tanks involved in the fire (see short report).
Official action taken - legal action: An investigation is being carried out by the State Attorneys Office. The judicial seizure of the equipment and plants involved in the accident was ordered.Official action taken - other official action: Following the accident a special meeting of the competent regional technical committee was organised as foreseen by decrees implementing the Seveso Directive in Italian law.  During the meeting, after having evaluated the gravity of the accident, a series of safety measures to be adopted by the establishment in the short and medium term were identified. These included the delocalisation of the gasoline storage tanks nearest to the railway track and the public roads towards the area near the shore.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Concerning points C and D, it has
been decided to maintain the default indication NO. This choice has
been made because an official inspection ordered by the Minister of the
Environment (in compliance with art 18 of Directive 96/82/EU) is being
carried out with the specific goal to verify the implementation by the
establishment management of the Safety Management System with regards
to the prevention of major accidents. During the follow up of to the
inspection it will be mandatory to consider the consequences of the
accident that occurred. This will also be the appropriate seat to
evaluate the adequacy of the measures taken concerning points c) an d).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: Considering the accident dynamics causing the death of two refinery employees, who were also members of the refinery emergency response team, and considering the assumptions made with respect to the causes of the accident, it is reasonable to expect that maintenance and operating procedures of the installations have to be reviewed and that training of the operators in charge of these operations has to be improved.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

It was possible to stop the uncontrolled gas leak by closing the so-called Shear Preventer.Emergency measures: safety measures: a large number of fire teams were deployed after the explosion and cooled the probe with water. Specialist firms were also called in to secure the probe. The police sealed off roads outside the premises as a precautionary measure.The efforts of the onsite and offsite emergency response services were well coordinated.Damage repaired: specialist firms have been put in charge of repairing damage inside the plant area. The minor damage caused outside the plant (broken glass) has been repaired. Safety measures by offsite emergency response services: fire fighting;Evacuation measures by offsite&amp;nbsp; emergency response services: 43 people were evacuated from neighbouring allotment gardens from 10.46 am - 11.53 am as a precautionary measure.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence:Following the emergency response measures implemented directly after the accident, operations to re-establish the functionality of the probe head were started on the basis of a specific work program. It was noticed that the probe's inner channel is blocked from a depth of approx. 4.20 m and it is therefore not possible to examine the underground part of the probe using the equipment currently available. For this reason, the operator of the underground gas storage installation is developing a new work program which includes a risk assessment for the measures to be implemented. The program is designed to ensure that the probe can drive over its full extent, to supervise the dismantling of the probe and to restore the probe to a safe condition for mining.Restriction measures:&amp;nbsp; In future, only staff directly involved in the work will be on the site inside the plant for the duration of the operation.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The clothes of the two process operators were cut open and removed from their bodies since their clothes were to some extent suspected of serving as a poisonous gas trap. The two process operators were rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital where doctors concluded that the two operators had deceased. Storage of the bodies at the hospital caused some problems because they&amp;nbsp; emitted large amounts of H2S.Emergency measures - Remarks:From the factory the national emergency alarm centre was phoned as soon as the accident had been detected. The emergency centre sent out the local Rescue Service, a staffed ambulance, and notified the local hospital via telefax.Official action taken - legal action: The court fined the company 70,000 Euros for breaking The Occupational Safety and Health  Act. They also fined the Director 1300 Euros and gave him a conditional sentence.Official action taken - other official action: Investigation reports from the Swedish Board of Accident Investigation and the Swedish National Labour Inspectorate have been prepared.

solutions to which sodium sulphide is to be added (for precipitation of
heavy metals) must be properly pH checked prior to addition of sodium
sulphide. The pH value must be at least 4.5. It is of paramount
importance that firm, well planned working procedures are adhered to in
this type of industry. Improvised procedures introduce great risk.Measures to prevent recurrence: Improved management routines and improved safety training of the staff were found to be necessary. A review is also necessary in order to check if there are more critical parameters which should be analysed on a routine basis in order to ensure safety and minimize risks. The entire staff at the process factory in question need to change their attitude in a direction which caters for more consideration of safety and risk related aspects. The accident also highlights the difficulties of assessing staff education, general knowledge and experience in safety matters for the authorities.Measures to mitigate consequences: Psychological counselling of co-workers and relatives of the deceased took place soon after the accident had occurred.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

This modification will be carried out after authorisation of the judicial authority in charge of the investigation.Besides immediate measures to be taken with respect to the probable causes of the accident, the Inspectorate for Classified Installations is studying longer term technical changes to minimise the hazards caused by the unavoidable formation of these gases.For this reason the Inspectorate has asked the operator to study and propose feasible measures to optimise the management procedures of the filter cake storage (amounts produced, storage time, aeration frequencies of the piles) and to avoid areas of possible gas accumulation.The Classified Installations Inspectorate has also requested an updating of the Safety Report concerning all activities of the installation.The Classified Installations Inspectorate has also requested an updating of the Safety Report concerning all activities of the installation.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

5. Carried out maintenance instructions as a minimum requirement for the main machines, installations and equipments which regulate the schedule of maintenance, the technological content, its accomplishment and the control for all of them.
6. The procedure of the delivery of the working area was supervised and refined as well as the MEFTIR system. The synchronisation of the logistical instructions.
7. MOL obligated the tank cleaning company to prepare a preliminary HSE plan within a part for the instruction of the tank cleaning process (based on an organised programme). It must be commented by the operator and approved together with the HSE organisation. The process of the delivery of the working area should happen exclusively with possessing the approved HSE plan. Workers can get permit for work only following this procedure.
8. In case of tank cleaning the continuous analysis of the air space will be obligatory (regarding other activities it is under consideration).
9. Supervision of the supplier and the Vendor management.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">At the time of the accident, the operators alerted the emergency services and cut the electricity supply and the oxygen feed.An "urgent" prefect's decree was promulgated on 28 February 2000, requiring an identification of the causes and consequences as well as the implementation of the preventive measures before any resumption of the operation of furnace No. 2.The inspectorate requires the preparation of an expert's assessment by a specialised organisation which is independent of the company, on the following three topics:- The probable causes of the accident,- An overview of accidents in this sector of industrial activities, and the reasons why the identified causes are considered as likely;- The types of batches or castings which the application for a start-up will refer to. That application will be evaluated on the basis of risks and of the planned compensation measures.The operator presents a report on 24 March 2000. The expert's report is presented on 27 March 2000. The prefect's decree of 7 April 2000 authorises the operator to resume the operation of furnace No. 2 for the fusion of 3 groups of substances, according to the operational modes validated by the expert. The decree prescribes also the preparation of a modelling-study of the phenomena which led to the accident, as well as the updating of an update of the safety report (last version: September 1996).The modelisation study was conducted by the Laboratoire de Thermodynamique et de Physico-Chimie Métallurgique at the Institut National Polytechnique of Grenoble, France. Based on small-scale tests (200g of sand, 1kg of cast iron), the study confirmed the scenario of a sudden release of gas due to the deoxidation of the nickel oxide contained in the sand.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The main lessons to learn from this accident may be summarised as follows:&amp;nbsp;- The unexpected and uncontrolled reaction in the furnace is the origin of the accident.&amp;nbsp;- The presence of people near the furnace at the time of the accident increased the human toll.&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; Adequate operating procedures are sufficient to prevent the occurrence of this kind of accidents.As a result, the operator had to take measures:&amp;nbsp;- Modification of the area surrounding the furnace: protective panels for observation purposes and certain operations, the creation of circulation zones, regulated access near the furnace,&amp;nbsp;- Revision of all the operating procedures, safety instructions (individual protective equipment ..),&amp;nbsp;- Recruitment of a safety engineer for the site.The accident proved that basic precautions are required around a metallurgical furnace; in this instance, the routine, the poor understanding of the risks by the management and the operators allowed individuals to get into a dangerous situation.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

In 3-4 minutes the squad-leader informed the local fire-station and also the county emergency directorate. The competent managers of the company were ordered in. The plant firemen rescued the casualty (5:17), localized the fire, and then extinguished. The local firemen arrived at site (5:30) helped in post-accident activity. The seriously injured worker was brought to central medical ambulance and from there to county hospital. Meanwhile the informed leaders of authorities arrived. The fire-fighting was finished by 6:20. The reconstruction of the installation was finished by 22. 09. 2003.Seveso II duties - remarks: By the time of accident the safety analysis of the plant was not prepared. The amended government decree of 2/2001 stated 1st April 2003 as deadline for sending in the safety analyses, thus the plant could fulfill the SEVESO II obligations and undertakings only in part.Discussion about the response:At 5:15 on 3rd December 2002 fire-alarm came from the plant, which was confirmed also by phone. The firemen went to site immediately with all of the fire-extinguishing equipments. 4 person and the safety officer on duty went to the site.Fire was seen in room for weighing dangerous material.Exploring the sit they observed one person in fire. The reinforced glass wall beside the door has been broken by the firemen. The person in fire stepped out.The officer on duty and the workers helped the casualty to get into the car and in transport. At 5:20 the staff was ordered to assemble one fire-extinguisher powder-gusher and extinguish the fire of unknown material, which went out by using the powder-gusher. Meanwhile the firemen noticed that there is fire around the toluene-tank.They experienced that the equipment were in fire, heavy, black smoke coming through the door. The staff was ordered to replace the powder-gusher. While the replace of powder-gusher was not ready they started to extinguish the fire with 50 kg dry chemical extinguisher placed near to the room. The fire went out, but we saw leak on top of the equipment and on two places behind o fit, which reinflamed in short time. By that time the replacement of powder-gusher was done and we shot the powder. After this the fire went out, and then 2-3 times reinflamed and liquid material was leaking further to the top of the equipment and behind the equipment. Because of this in about one minute after extinguishing the fire there was a larger reinflame of fire, but it was also extinguished with powder-gusher, but because of these inflammations the electrical lines under the ceiling on cable-ladder were in flame and the fire spread in direction of control room. By this time I ordered to replace the powder-gusher to the other entrance and we tried to get a reinflaming fire under. By this time arrived the department leader. After consulting with him beside applying the powder-gusher, they ordered to assemble a water-gusher, because they got by this time the putting out declaration of electrical office on duty. After this the electrical cable and minor reinflames were extinguished by water-gusher. The gusher had to be replaced to direction of control room, because the fire spread on cable to that direction. Meanwhile the fire-protection leader arrived, who ordered a worker and/or a fireman to install a generator-lighting to the entrance near to control room. Further this door was used for extinguishing the cable fire. Two firemen started to explore the upper floor, with help of firemen, who arrived by that time. Because of high temperature and heavy smoke the orientation was not easy, but they did not experienced fire in the upper floor, only in the right lower part of the computer room. For extinguishing of this fire a new gusher was assembled, in which the firemen helped. The fire went out in minutes, later the focus went to cooling the equipment, and/or in upper floor, furthermore in ground floor the drying external door and the transit door in front of the fire were opened.Later we got request to cool the centrifugal machine and the equipment above, which was requested by the division leader.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

Measures to prevent recurrence:&amp;nbsp; Following measures were ordered in the plant in connection with the incident on 3rd December 2002. In every case, the deadlines and responsible persons were determined.1. Pneumatic pipelines:- By installing new pneumatic systems the standard color marking for pipelines has to be applied.- In case of existing systems - where via the pneumatic pipelines both compressed air and nitrogen are used - the pipelines for nitrogen has to be changed for yellow color.2. The nitrogen flushing of the space between liquid phase outlet and liquid seal - which is "dead space" in regard of inertization - has to be solved.3. The exchange of&amp;nbsp;flexible pipes to rigid ones - ensuring the gas-tight function between the centrifugal machines and centrifugal wagon, applying solid material sealing and the coupling assuring the gas-tight state by mechanical way has to be considered. If it is not possible, then supply of inflatable tubes shall be provided by nitrogen. 4. The exchange of filtering centrifugal machine FI-231 and applying other type of filtering equipment.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The investigation formed the basis for a report which was forwarded to the omissis Environment Office in accordance with Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents.MEASURES PROPOSED AND ADOPTEDFollowing the MIA, the plant operator took the following measures, setting deadlines for their implementation:• Temporary procedure for operation at up to 120 000 m3 until start-up of BFG storage tank (deadline: 16 November 2006);• Start-up of heating plant boiler No 2 to increase BFG draw-off – total of six boilers (deadline: 16 November 2006);• Further investigation of an event two weeks previously – combustion stack outage (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Verification of functioning of stacks, their supply and control from the control room in the event of undervoltage – simulated undervoltage (deadline: 4 December 2006);• Establishment of three crews to work in emergencies using protective insulating devices (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Allocation to the anti-gas protection post of one-hour protective insulation devices – at least 30% of devices (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Training for every shift maintenance team on priority treatment of stack control and the site of potential failures (deadline: 24 November 2006);• Installation of a back-up source for heating-plant boiler No 1 and a stack management system in the CO monitoring control room (deadline: 31 December 2006);The plant operator has adopted the following official measures to prevent the recurrence of a major industrial accident of this or a similar type.• Continuous operational control of the volume of BFG burnt in combustion stacks 2 and 3 in order to cope with the failure of a major draw-off appliance and to monitor the stacks in accordance with the occupational safety procedure (deadline: 18 November 2006);• Increase in the stability of supply to the burners of heating-plant boiler No 1 in the event of undervoltage (back-up source) (deadline: end 2006);• Identification of critical equipment in the light of the installation of back-up sources, and preventive maintenance for back-up sources (deadline: Q1 2007);• Archiving of data (detailed records) from the omissis system for one week (deadline: 30 November 2006);• Proposal for a system for monitoring power supply and losses in the case of high-voltage substations and establishment of harmonised system time for operational computers (deadline: Q1 2007);• Proposal for on-off arrangement for combustion stacks at approximately 100 000 m3 (deadline: technical development panel – December 2006);• Proposal for self-regenerating pressure traps for gas (deadline: end 2006).The omissis Inspectorate, in accordance with Section 13(3)(b) of Act No 95/2000 on labour inspection and amending certain acts, as amended, has ordered the Company to:• Ensure adequate risk assessment and adopt safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the safety and health of employees and other persons present on the employer’s premises (deadline: immediate and continuous);• Ensure removal of BFG from pressure traps so that they are not located in the breathing zone, in accordance with Section 6(1)(d) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work;- Deadline: within 30 days from receipt of the report.The omissis Environment Office has proposed the following measures:• Drafting of an emergency scenario for this type of BFG release from BFG distributor pipes;• Incorporation of this scenario in the plant’s emergency plan;• Adaptation of the risk assessment with regard to the main BFG distributor to take suitable account of similar situations;The deadline for the measures proposed by the omissis Office is the date of the next updating of the Company plant’s safety report.CONCLUSION AND EVALUATIONOn the basis of the information received from the omissis Inspectorate, which investigated the MIA at the Company plant, and of knowledge gained from the omissis Environment Office’s own activities, it may be concluded that the MIA was not caused by negligence on the part of the plant’s employees or operator, or by other organisations or persons present at the plant. The omissis Inspectorate has detected an infringement of the law, notably Section 6(1)(c), (d) and (f) of Act No 124/2006 on safety and health at work and amending certain acts and provisions, in that the organisation did not adequately assess the risk and also did not take safety measures to ensure safety and health at work so that a power cut or drop in the electricity supply does not result in an uncontrolled release of BFG to the air and put at risk the health and safety of employees and other persons present on the employer’s premises. The omissis Inspectorate has not imposed any penalties or issued a prohibition on the operation of the installation.The omissis Environment Office has proposed measures to prevent major industrial accidents at the Company which it will apply rigorously to the operator in the imminent updating of the plant’s safety report provided for in Section 9 of Act No 261/2002 on the prevention of major industrial accidents and amending certain acts, as amended.The major industrial accident at the Company occurred – and was caused – as result of a power supply failure and the subsequent failure of the plant’s technical and safety installations.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

the action according to this phase induces an announcement to the hierarchy of the company
if necessary fire control is asked by the fire brigade&amp;nbsp;

- the fire brigade is contacted with the message of a smoulder fire when:

the concentration of SO2 exceeds 1,5 ppm OR the concentration of H2S exceeds 4 ppm AND there is smoke AND there is a higher temperature in the piles of product
there are flames and glimmer seen from the pile of product

- the phase of smoulder is ended when the temperature of the pile of product is lower than 30 °C AND the concentration of H2S is lower than 4 ppm AND the concentration of SO2 is lower than 1,5 ppm AND there isn't any smoke anymore

This inspection is carried out according to a checklist, the closing of every single potential opening of the flue-gas duct being verified and validated through a signature by the person entrusted with the inspection.
Before each start-up and after any works involving the flue-gas duct of a converter, the tightness of the system is verified during the blowing process by a measurement of the oxygen pressure difference between two measurement points, located at the transversal stack and the isolating valves. Whenever any substantial differences between the two values are observed, the cause is identified and eliminated. 

Whenever specific concentrations are measured over a certain period of time, the blowing process is interrupted by a locking function of the process control system.

At 3:44&amp;nbsp;a.m. the in-house firefighting equipment (26,000 litres of water per minute and 6,300 litres of foam per minute) were deployed. The internal emergency plan was launched at 4:06 a.m. A security perimeter was set up and the road to the site was closed. The fire brigade was called as backup to carry out atmospheric readings around the site (H2S, SO2, NO2 and VOCs). At around 8:00 a.m., the prefecture recommended that local residents and employees of nearby companies stay indoors. The water used to extinguish the fire was collected and tested by the operator. Floating booms and absorbent socks were put in place in the canal beside the site. The fire was brought under control shortly after 8:00 am. As the atmospheric measurement network in place around the site had not detected anything, the recommendations to stay indoors were lifted at around 10:25 a.m. The main fire was put out at 11:30 a.m. Burning gas was still leaking at around 4:30 p.m. The last secondary fire was extinguished at around 6:00 p.m. Cooling continued at night.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The transfer activity must be described in more detail in the operation instructions or in a special work instruction. More detail should be provided on the following aspects:- the specified workflow (use of the barrel pump),- strict confinement of the transfer process to the transfer basin,- clear designation of the relevant potentially explosive zones,- use of suitable equipment in the zones,- use of suitable transport packaging (conductivity of the IBC),- ensuring that all fittings, work materials and equipment used during the transfer process are earthed. This includes the containers (barrels) to be filled and their peripheral equipment (funnels, ramps). The workers concerned should provide written confirmation that they have understood this. Structural fire protection:Following the incident, the main building can no longer be used, and it is currently being demolished. When planning the new building, the relevant regulations (above all the Industrial Buildings Directive [Industriebaurichtlinie — IndBauRL]) must be taken into account. Regardless of the resulting requirements that must be included in a structural fire protection plan, the experts recommend not only introducing fire protection means to separate the tank farm, the container storage facility and production facility from one another, but also separating the production facility into two fire compartments, as appropriate, to minimise the extent to which an initial fire can spread throughout the whole building.For the tank farm, which may still need to be used, the possibility of a secure sprinkler system must be provided, i.e. a second, independent water supply must be secured. Handling burning containers:Where a container is particularly hazardous, e.g. it is leaking or there is a (small) fire, arrangements must be made as to how it can be handled safely.In any event, it must be ensured that the burning container is not moved. Emergency drills:The operator should carry out emergency drills for ‘typical’ operational disruptions, such as leaks, overfilling or initial fires, in order to practice proper procedure. These drills should not be announced to operational staff.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Operators shut-down the plant and shut-off the fuel supply. 4 people of the company fire brigade provided to extinguish the fire. The decontamination of plant started.Emergency measures - Remarks: On site fire team and plant personnel extinguished fire and shut off fuel supply to fire (refinery treat gas).Discussion about response: The incident occurred during the activation of a platinum catalyst using refinery treat gas and had several causes. 1. Catalyst activation was not taken into account during the reactor design. 2. A high temperature trip device was not provided. 3. The original risk assessment did not consider the catalyst activation stage and dismissed the possibility of a runaway exothermic reaction.4. During initial plant start-up in 1991 and catalyst activation at 400 degrees Celsius an exotherm was experienced, the cause was identified as hydro cracking of parafins in the treat gas but no further action was taken. 5. In 1994 during a preliminary hot de-waxed treatment at 430 degrees Celsius, temperature indicators were seen to be out of range. No investigation was made. The settings of the temperature indicators was 410 and 450 Celsius although the instruments had a potential maximum of 1000 Celsius. All alarms were set at 405 Celsius. 6. The reactor installation was provided with an emergency shut-down control which was manually activated and required operators to respond correctly to the situation. 7. In May 1994 a new catalyst was to be activated. Temperature 430 Celsius was planned, there was no risk assessment on this change in operating conditions. The first activation was done at 400 Celsius. Refinery change procedures called for a review if there were significant changes in operating conditions but no review was carried out. 8. During the activation stage 3 people went out onto the reactor ladders and platforms at various times, if they had been present when the reactor ruptured they would have been caught by the fire. 9. The causes of the incident can be summed up as follows: &amp;nbsp; (1) Failure to understand the processes occurring in the reactor and the effect of an increase in temperature on the rate of exothermic reactions. &amp;nbsp; (2) Inadequate cooling facilities. &amp;nbsp; (3) An inadequate control system and the absence of a high temperature trip device. &amp;nbsp; (4) Inadequate operational procedures and training of managers, engineers and operators.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident, the plant was shut-down and the reactor purged. Its contents was removed and the reactor was prepared to open it to allow an internal examination.

It was found that the temperature indicators on reactor had maximum readings below expected temperatures. Besides, no high temperature trips were fitted.Useful references: very little published information on runaway exotherm in continuous reactors. Case report in Safety Digest of American Petroleum institute, Publication 758 Section 2 1979 Capter 5 is similar to this incident. Also "Chemical Reaction Hazards - A Guide" Editors Barton and Rogers published by IChemEng 1993 and IChemSymposium Series No. 85 "Protection of Exothermic Reactors and Pressurised Storage Vessels". Hydro cracking and thermal cracking of parafins at the temperatures experienced in this reactor are widely reported in standard text books.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Workers on the site reported the fire to the industrial fire brigade and were able to initiate the internal emergency plan. The industrial fire brigade arrived at the scene 3-4 minutes after the alarm and began extinguishing the fire. Once it became apparent that the industrial fire brigade could not take the fire under control, the professional fire service was alarmed.&amp;nbsp; The industrial fire brigade took part in the operation with 6 fire trucks and 11 firemen, while the professional fire service deployed 14 fire trucks and 36 firemen. During the intervention, 2 mounted and 2 installable water cannons were operated and 4 foam nozzles and 4 water nozzles were used to take the fire under control. 2 CBRN Hazmat Units performed continuous meteorological and concentration measurements on-site and in the residential area to protect the firefighters and the population around the plant.
The operation was hindered because the extinguishing water mixed with solvents harmful to health and dangerous to the environment, and the mixture overflowed the bund so the contaminated extinguishing water had to be pumped during the operation. Also, it was not possible to completely extinguish the fire under the collapsed roof structure until it was removed.
Summary of the extent of the fire as the incident progressed:
- Upon the arrival of the industrial fire brigade, the Open warehouse burned to approximately 600-700 m2.
- The fire spread to combustible materials stored in the vicinity of the warehouse, which meant an additional 200 m2 of fire-area.
- By the time the professional fire service arrived, the Open warehouse and the surrounding area were already on fire at 1,200 m2.
- In total, the fire affected about 6,000 m2, which included the area of the Open warehouse itself, the outside storage area in its vicinity, the greenery within the site area and of the surrounding plants (not Seveso sites).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The most relevant lessons learned are the following:

- Operators should check the filling degree of the containers, containing hazardous waste liquids, prior to receiving.


- Operators should consider and, where appropriate, limit the amount of hazardous waste received and collected at the site.


- The well-known, direct partner's deliveries should be subject to the same examination as the new and unknown deliveries.


- Operators should pay attention to the deliberate design of the storage-procedures where storing together different types of hazardous wastes, considering the amount of hazardous substances at the same time, as well as their potential hazardous reactions with each other.


- To increase safety and prevent the harmful effects of temperature rise of the stored wastes, the practice of controlling the temperature of the stored materials (manually or automated) should be developed.


- Hazardous waste treatment plants should pay exceptional attention to the prevention of spillage and the damage of packaging on their sites.


- In order to detect and extinguish the fires quickly, automated fire detection and extinguishing system installation should be considered for the storage facilities of flammable liquids and solid wastes, even if it would not be mandatory by an official or legal obligation.
&amp;nbsp;
- During the intervention, the possible harmful effects of the extinguishing water must be monitored. Good practices that can be developed with the involvement of the firefighters can have further mitigating effects on the environmental risk of the extinguishing water used.

The emergency response services arrived on the site approximately 10 minutes after having been called. The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) was notified by the emergency response service of the fire brigade one hour after the accident. The management of the installation was not present on-site when the accident occurred. The management reached the installation at 13:15 h following an explicit request of the Classified Installation Inspectorate (DRIRE). The Onsite Contingency Plan (POI - Plan d'Opération Interne) was only activated by the operator&amp;nbsp; 2 hours later.The emergency response services responded by sending the chemical emergency unit and several vehicles (pump-trucks and ambulances equipped to carry victims injured or asphyxiated ). The spray water collected in the retention ponds was evacuated to&amp;nbsp; a specialised company for disposal.Sampling of hydrogen chloride was performed (with Dräger detector tube) by the emergency response services&amp;nbsp; near the storage area and downwind at the outskirts of the premises. No abnormal situation was found 2 hours after the occurrence.The public emergency response operation was partially called off in the late afternoon.Immediate consequencesAfter sealing the leak in correspondence with the joint, no other leakage was visible on the tank the evening after the accident. The chemical reaction process had stopped and the system had returned to a stable condition. On request of the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) a continuous monitoring of the installations was set up and the mandatory presence of a management representative was&amp;nbsp; imposed&amp;nbsp; for the night and&amp;nbsp; renewed during the following days. A tarpaulin was installed above the tank to protect the tank against atmospheric agents.The Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) requested the operator to prepare a technical report ( the request was also supported by&amp;nbsp; an urgent prefectoral order) describing the securing works to be performed, the preventive measures to be taken concerning the safety of the operations as well as the necessary emergency&amp;nbsp; response means. Before performing any other operation, the setting up of a new emptying procedure for the tank was requested, the procedure being subject to validation by a third party expert.Two distinct stages were defined: - on one hand preparatory works for securing the storage installation- on the other hand the emptying procedure itself with the cleaning of the tank, these procedures&amp;nbsp; were subject to validation by a third party expert before approval by the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE).The operations foreseen comprised five phases:- Phase 1 - securing operation- Phase 2 - repair of the leakage point- Phase 3 - fluidisation and homogenisation- Phase 4 - emptying of the tank- Phase 5 - decontaminationThe first two phases were carried out on 19th March 2002. The following phases, were performed at the end of April 2002 in accordance with an expert report by INERIS&amp;nbsp; and the transfer of the product to a centre for the disposal of hazardous waste was performed on 30th April 2002.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Following the event, the Prefect of Val d'Oise issued an urgent prefectoral order dated 13th February 2002, applying article L 512-7 of the Environmental Regulations obliging the operator to take measures&amp;nbsp; for cleaning and securing the installations, for dismantling the installations, for avoiding the recurrence of a similar event considering that a storage installation for hazardous substances is present on the site. This prefectoral order obliged the company to issue and submit for approval the procedures prior to the emptying operations of the benzoyl chloride tank and of another tank containing aluminium chloride (CAS 7446-70-0); the procedures were subject to validation by a third party expert.The Classified Installations Inspectorate also requested the operator to submit&amp;nbsp; an accident report. The analysis of the accident report and the on-site investigation have shown the following failures:- failure to notify the accident to the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE)- absence of a management representative on the site and failure in managing the organisation and decision chain with respect to the safety issues- late release of the onsite contingency plan- organisational failure of the operator in managing the immediate consequences of the accident- corrosion of the external tank wall- overflow alarm of the tank not connected to the control room- bad condition of the joint on the man-hole flange of the tank- carrying out of the emptying procedure presenting hazards to the personnel and the environment consequent to a faulty hazard assessment which led to the use of incompatible substances and a wrong evaluation of the consequences of such an operation.- missing hazard labelling on the methanol container- bad condition of the fire fighting hoses on the site- The validity of a certain number of Dräger detector tubes for HCl had expired in 1998</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The onsite fire brigade and the onsite sanitary relief service intervened in response to the event. Although emergency response measures were taken immediately, the emergency response operation encountered difficulties in reaching the accident point located in a gallery some 15 m from the ground, due to the presence of equipment and provisory structures.Emergency measures - Remarks: The onsite sanitary relief service and the onsite fire brigade intervened, providing first aid assistance to the persons involved in the accident and transported them from the accident point to the emergency response vehicles for the transport to hospital.
Measures have been taken to gather basic information for the accident analysis.
Official action taken - legal action: The Attorney General's office is investigating the causes of the fatal accident occurred to the worker. During this procedure an official technical consultancy report has been deposited, the report has been used to prepare the present report.Responce - Discussion about responce: Following measures have been adopted by the company:Relation with external contractors:-The company plans to modify the safety management system by increasing the frequency and type of preventive controls on the activities performed by the external contractors. - Further the company plans the integration and improvement of the content of the training courses for the external contracting companies and the onsite personnel.Revision of working permit delivery procedure: - Clearer definition of the responsibilities of the onsite personnel;- Modification of the forms with the objective to indicate clearer the hazard sources present in the work area;- Definition of standards concerning the information content of the safety reports to be presented by external contractors;- Definition of the authorisation delivery process to access the equipment and eventually use open flames.Mitigation measures:- The company has reinforced and optimized the sanitary service concerning the training of the doctors, nurses, drivers, security personnel and plant personnel, and&amp;nbsp; foreseeing first aid measures provided by a series of vehicles with first aid equipment, dislocated onsite such to reach any accident point much faster than the onsite ambulance. - The onsite fire brigade has been reinforced from 4 members per shift to 6 memebrs. All members of the onsite fire brigade have received an integrative training of 120 hrs by the provincial fire department.The accident analysis has pointed out the difficulties encountered in reaching the working area in which the accident occurred, due to the presence of permanent equipment structures and provisory structures. For this reason the company has adopted measures to facilitate the access to the working areas (e.g. mobile platforms) and in this way facilitate the evacuation of the personnel in case of an emergency.The decision to equip the personnel with additional pressure air cylinders has the objective to facilitate the evacuation in safe condition in case of emergency, allowing to shut down the central air circulation system and automatically switch to the reserve air cylinders.Seveso II duties  - remarks: The safety report dated 2000 has
been evaluated with a negative result because the documentation
provided has been considered as insufficient. Presently the safety
report dated 2006 is under evaluation.
The accident scenarios considered in safety report did not take into
account the accident dynamics of this accident because it can not be
classified as accidental release. The accident was manged according to
the emergency response plan as generic emergency and as such was
competence of the onsite fire brigade and the onsite sanitary service.
The conclusion concerning inadequate training and information level
have been taken from the official technical consultancy report given in
charge by the Attorney General's Office and refers specifically to the
personnel of external contractors and subcontractors. The report does
not make any reference concerning the behaviour of the ILVA worker, who
rushed to the accident place without protective equipment.

Activities of production shift staff, shift security services and other participants in the incident were done in accordance with the "Plan in case of danger". Fire was not immediately extinguished (in order to prevent creating an explosive mixture of gas and air). Instead the equipment was cooled with large quantities of chilled water until the remaining gas was burned. Larger quantities of water, which with waste water system ended in Place processes, have been retained and analysed by the Environmental Protection Department before being discharged into the sea. Access to the place of accident was not allowed until everything was checked out, prepared and after it was determined that there was no more risk of injury.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">To prevent the recurrence of such incidents, a range of various measures have been implemented or will be implemented.
A Commission was formed in order to determine the cause of accident. A technician of the high pressure compressor manufacturer was contacted to establish the actual status of the damage and to determine the failure causes and consequences of the incident. The shooting out of the "drive rod" screw was found to be the main cause leading to the incident. There is already a practice that every year, during the overhaul, ultrasonic testing of components of the high pressure compressor, including the screws was performed. The last testing was conducted in October 2008 and no failures/defaults were observed. The testing was performed by an external company „Inženjnering komerc " d.o.o.. In the production unit we already use the most modern control system to monitor parameters such as gas temperature in the cylinder, intake and pressure, temperature of the sliding tracks, vibrations measured on the compressor casing, temperature of the cold oil. Alarms are activated in the control room when these parameters deviate from their normal operating range. In this way, we want to achieve early identification of problems in order to be able to interrupt production processes in a safe way to avoid any disastrous consequences.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Discharges from the electrolysis workshop were diverted to the emergency tanks.
On 31 March, the prefect issued an emergency order banning discharges from incineration units and requiring monitoring of the daily readings at water intake stations and in the environment. On 3 April, the measurements taken on the company’s discharges were all below the detection threshold.
Until the situation at the water intake station permanently improved, the operator put in place an ultrafiltration unit to supply drinking water. The operator also installed a mobile osmosis treatment station to treat the 10,000&amp;nbsp;m³ of polluted water stored in the containment tanks.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

In parallel with this action, the mayors of the towns in the vicinity were informed. The firefighters, the ambulance, the National Public Health and Medical Officer Service (ANTSZ), the relevant environmental inspectorate and the civil protection units were alarmed. Constant air pollution monitoring was carried out. Elimination began after the alarming of these bodies. Emergency measures - Remarks: The unloading of the chlorine from tanker to storage tank was begun on 24th July 1999. At this time 4850 kg was unloaded. Purging was carried out and the pipelines were removed. The tanker was reconnected on 29th July again and unloading was begun, which was completed on 30th July. The pipeline was purged after unloading. At this time the tanker remained connected for unloading. On 7th September, the unloader was intended to be sprayed by sand and so that the tanker would not be affected by this action, they intended to fix it. At the fixation, the nitrogen connection was removed, it was no problem, however the operator observed leakage during the disconnection of liquid chlorine discharging pipe. At this time the valve was attempted to close, which did not move, and the chlorine began to leak. After this, the worker on the ground put on a breathing equipment and attempted to close the apparatus. The valve spindle rotated freely, therefore the manual valve was inoperable. According to the operator, based on the position of the handle, the bottom spring safety valve was in closed condition. The alarm was initiated by the chief foreman, the firefighter brigade of the facility moved to the site and started the absorption of the constantly leaking chlorine by establishing water shield. In the meantime the alarmed units arrived to the site (firefighters, policemen, chemical rescue team of BC Rt.). The arrived civil protection unit carried out constant measurements. Hazardous material did not get into the atmosphere. The chlorine
leakage ceased at 5 pm, 30 minutes later the units returned to their
quarters. After this the damage assessment and the reconstruction works
began.Official action taken - legal action: There was no legal action. The expert's report on the damage was accepted by all authorities. Environmental authority requested Action plan, the implementation of which was checked. Official action taken - other official action: The operator had to pay 4,000 Euro fee for the labour protection authority.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The water is not drained until just before the fillers are removed in order to prevent the polymerisates from drying out.- Connection of the column’s recirculation pipe to the water network in order to pour up to 20 t/h of water into the head of the column immediately any decomposition reaction begins.

On-site arrived a group of experts for a technical survey. They established that:- there was no immediate danger for the population to justify the immediate evacuation of the area because the released gases were immediately burned by the various small fires still existing;- to maintain the 3 controlled fires on the existing openings of the plant and create a safety zone with a water curtain for cooling the nearby plants and tanks. In this way the escaping gases were completely burned thus avoiding the risk of creating an explosive mixture and the presence of asphyxiating gases;- it was decided to left open the steam column existing in the lowest part of the storage tanks zone, to cool the metallic supports of the tanks;- it was decided by ICAM, and approved by the experts, to set up a flare connected with the various points of the plant for burning the propylene coming from the refrigerating plant, and the other substances already in the plant, thus accelerating the exhaustion of the fire on the base of the cracking columns.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The road traffic No 114 Catania-Siracusa was diverted and the rail traffic was disrupted due to the existing risk of fire in the tanks yard and in the cracking columns. This because it was not possible to exclude that a collapse of the column splitter Ethylene (80 m high) could involve the adjacent cracking columns, still full of highly flammable substances. The adjacent harbour of Agusta was closed. Fires had been estinguished in a radius of 60 metres from the plant.It was decided by ICAM, and approved by the experts, to set up a flare connected with the various points of the plant for burning the propylene coming from the refrigerating plant, and the other substances already in the plant, thus accelerating the exhaustion of the fire on the base of the cracking columns (code 7999).

In future, the systems will be evacuated on a large scale and a remote diagnosis will be carried out to assess the event and take further measures.
In order to better understand the extent and magnitude of such events, the number of gas sensors in the relevant areas will be increased.
The operability of the on-site fire brigade’s control room and fire station will in future be organised in such a way that they remain fully operational even in the event of major damaging events.
Following the event, a procedural plan was developed in consultation with the competent authorities. This plan was set out in a decision and regulates the following issues:

Further securing of the systems in operation (e.g. tank storage, flare, utilities) by way of tests that allow them to continue to operate.
Securing of the process plants that were shut down during the event - Emptying of systems and testing before restart.

Testing on all systems was carried out in accordance with the legal requirements.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The tank was isolated.All electrical equipment was switched off.The product remaining in tank T-3002 was transferred in tanks T-3001 and T-3004 with fixed pumps.The crude oil was still spilling out from the tank, while the onsite fire brigade together with the public fire brigade from the Provincial Command of Taranto, alerted by the safety manager of the refinery, sprayed the surface of the spilled crude oil in the retention basin with foaming agents, using mobile fire extinguishing equipment, such to keep the oil surface covered with foam. The crude oil vapour/air concentrations were continuously monitored in correspondence of the top of the containment basin dam. The concentration levels determined during monitoring variated 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.The railway lines Taranto - Bari,&amp;nbsp; Taranto- Metaponto were cut as a precautionary measure until 5:30 hrs. on 2/05/2006.The state road S.S 106 Ionica was closed and patrolled by police in the tract adjacent to the tank for a shorter period of time.The area affected by the spillage was put under continuous surveillance by the onsite fire fighting team and by the public fire brigade of Taranto. Several teams of the public fire brigade intervened until 19:00 hrs on 5/05/2006, when emptying operation of the containment basin terminated.Emergency measures - Remarks: Following difficulties were encountered during the emergency response operation
- The  transfer of a large amount of product (approx 52.000 m3) from the damaged tank to tanks T-3001 and T-3004 caused difficulties in the  process, due to the fact that the release rate of the spilling product was much higher than the capacity the fixed pumps, 4 mobile pumps had to be rented
- Maintaining a constant foam level on the spilled product, in order to avoid formation of explosive/flammable air/product mixtures, was very difficult due to the fact that the basin surface was very large (approx: 14.000 m2 including the surface covered by the tank), and that the spilling liquid was causing a strong turbulence associated with the wind.
-  There was the risk that the spilling product could overflow the dams of the containment basin (having an equivalent volume to  the failed tank) due to the amounts of foam sprayed on the crude oil surface.
- During the entire operation he crude oil vapour/air concentrations were continuously monitored in correspondence of the top of the containment basin dam. The concentration levels determined during the monitoring ranged 4% to 14% of the lower flammability threshold limit.

Official action taken - legal action: The General Attorney's Office of Taranto has opened an  information procedure on a non criminal event. The General Attorney has not given not requested an official technical consultancy report.Official action taken - other official action: The company notified the accident in compliance with art 24 leg. Decree N.334/99 (article 14 of the Seveso Directive 96/82/CE) and communicated the contamination occurred in compliance to environmental legislation (legislative decree N. 152/2006);
and started the official procedures for executing the remediation operations with respect to the contaminated soil in the retention basin.
At present  (date of this report) following steps have been concluded:
- Classification of the contaminated soil in the retention basin 
- Environmental- and Health- Risk Analysis 
- The validation of the Environmental- and Health- Risk Analysis by the environmental Ministry is expected
Discussion about response: Immediate response
At the date of  the present report tank T-3002 had still not been inspected internally. Therefore the causes of the tank rupture, localized on the bottom section of the tank shell, cannot be determined.
Concerning the emergency response operation, both the onsite emergency plan and the offsite emergency plan were triggered permitting to avoid the evolution of the event into a worst case scenario.

Long term response
The company reserves the right to make any technical, organisational and management changes once the causes of the tank rupture is clearly established, after an internal inspection of the tank is performed, which at the actual state of the works is foreseen for June 2007.
Meanwhile the company:
- did not consider it necessary to change the existing tank inspection and control procedures
- has confirmed that double bottoms will be installed in the tanks according to the program which started in 2004 and is scheduled to end in 2010 
- The company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.
- The company has already started official procedures for organising the remediation operations comprising the opening, inspection, repair end refurbishment of the tank (double bottom), and has started the official procedure foreseen in legislative decree  Dlgs 152/2006 which will conclude with the remediation operations of the contaminated soil in the containment basin.
Seveso II Duties- Remarks:The Regional Technical Committee (CTR)&amp;nbsp; has concluded his evaluation of the safety report 2005 in November 2006, prescribing following actions to be taken:- Installation of remote controls on the pumps and of the root valves of category A tanks (for liquids with flash point &amp;lt;21°C),- Installation of fixed extinguishing foam sprayers in proximity of containment basins of Category A tanks.- For floating roof tanks installation of redundant breathing valves- Installation of&amp;nbsp; valves at the end of&amp;nbsp; the rainwater drainage pipes in the floating roofs of Category A tanks. The safety report foresaw the catastrophic rupture of a crude oil tank with estimated soil contamination levels&amp;nbsp; higher than those effectively measured after the accident.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: The company had already programmed to install double bottoms in all tanks of category A and tanks for the for the storage of gas oil, in compliance with standard API 650,&amp;nbsp; and the Best Vailable Technology (BAT) of the sector, when the accident occurredThe&amp;nbsp; tank bottom&amp;nbsp; substitution program started in 2004 and is scheduled to terminate in 2010.Following the accident the company has been intensifying the control on the work progress in the tank bottom exchange program such to assure the respect of the timing defined.The company is evaluating the possibility to install double bottoms also in the combustible oil tanks.Moreover following the accident the structural conditions of 29 tanks were tested with acoustic emissions, but also in this case the operation was already planned.The company is waiting to determine the exact causes of the tank shell failure by an internal inspection of the tank, the company has not found elements to request a revision of the&amp;nbsp; existing tank testing procedures.Measures to mitigate consequences: The company reserves right to adopt specific mitigation measures once the exact causes of the accident are determined.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Installation of a filter at the point of discharge of the TDI residue to minimise possible chloride contamination through TDI residue dust.


Replacement of (similar) cover screws on all valves of the ODCB cold system.Using screws made of a different material was considered but deliberately ruled out, since, on the one hand, there is a high potential for corrosion on contact with the higher-alloy casing material when screws made of non-alloy and low-alloy material are used and, on the other, there is a high risk of confusion during maintenance when higher-alloy materials are used, in particular in the case of standard components such as screws, due to their very similar appearance.


Proper functioning of the cover screws will in future be ensured by periodically inspecting the screws on the valves of the ODCB cold system in the relevant part of the plant, in accordance with an inspection schedule agreed with the authority.The nature and scope of the inspection programme will be periodically assessed in close coordination with the authority on the basis of the results obtained, and will be improved if necessary.


In other areas of the TDI plant, a representative sample of valves of the same design, distributed over the entire system, was selected to identify any damage to cover screws.


A representative sample of valves of the same design, distributed over the entire system, was selected to identify any damage to flange screws.


Furthermore, the company group instigated an inspection of cover screws on selected valves in other establishments on the site and in other TDI plants worldwide.


The operator was also kept informed of the examination of the case, the causes identified of the damage and the corrective measures taken.

In the present case, the consequences were limited to the basin and no additional measures were necessary.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

procedures for carrying out repairs was strengthened. 3. In order to ensure safe operation of technological
equipment for oil processing, prepare studies for the risk analysis of possible
accidents at omissis, clarify accident elimination plans and the
safety report. 4. In order to ensure safe operation of technological
devices for oil processing, cover the supporting metal constructions of
analogous devices with fire-proof material. 5. The time between repairs of devices may only be prolonged
after modernising the device or strengthening the testing and inspection system. 6. Install video monitoring systems of dangerous equipment. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Technical measures:
1) In order to prevent product from being released from the coupling when work instructions are not followed due to human error, the adapter used has been modified.Non-return valve on the adaptor:The adapter for use on tankers without a dry coupling counterpart is fitted with a non-return valve to prevent any residual products in the hose from being released if the union nut comes loose without having disconnected the dry coupling.
2) Pneumatically operated valves around the sampling equipment:The pipe connection to the sampling equipment, which is connected in parallel with the product path, has been fitted with pneumatically operated valves, which only open when the drain pump is running.Organisational measures:
1) Instructions to tanker drivers:The instruction forms used for the initial and annual training of tanker drivers have been updated and are now available in eight languages. Drivers are given a copy to keep.New tanker drivers are trained by operator staff in how to operate the installation and are allowed to operate it independently only once they have completed this training.
2) Work instructions:The work instructions for tanker drivers have been amended in line with the modified installation and allow tankers to be drained:- with the necessary PPE but without using a respirator mask when the dry coupling is used directly, i.e. without the adapter;- only with the necessary PPE and using a respirator mask as an additional safeguard against swallowing and inhalation of product residues when an adapter is used.&amp;nbsp;
The work instructions are posted in the facility in three languages. The following additions have been made:- Images showing how to correctly connect to the facility;- Operating instructions concerning the hazardous substances to be drained;- Operating instructions concerning PPE to be used, including breathing protection.&amp;nbsp;
3) Risk assessment of the tanker draining facility following the modification:After testing and introduction of the above-mentioned modification, a new risk assessment was carried out on the tanker draining facility by the external works safety expert. The technical and organisational measures that had been implemented at the time of the assessment were found to be ‘completed and effective’.
&amp;nbsp;
4) Working towards fitting tankers with dry coupling counterparts:
The tank farm operator itself has no business relationship with the transport companies delivering the product; it merely acts as a warehouse keeper for a fee.
A letter was sent to the product purchaser asking it to encourage the transport companies delivering the product to fit tankers with dry couplings, in order to increase safety during transhipment and prevent releases of product.
&amp;nbsp;
5) Informing offices in the parent company:
The relevant offices of the parent company (international group) have been informed. The incident and possible solutions are being evaluated to prevent similar occurrences.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The company fire crew equipped with breathing apparatuses, put out small fires. They were aided by the local fire emergency services. Three units of the local fire brigade arrived on the scene and found
that the fire was under control. Approximately 5 fire brigade personnel
aided the company fire crew in the pilot plant area. One fire brigade
crew remained on-site for two hours until the "all-clear" was given.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Approximately 3-5 policemen closed off the access road to the factory. Three units of the local fire brigade arrived on the scene and found that the fire was under control. Approximately 5 fire brigade personnel aided the company fire crew in the pilot plant area. One fire brigade crew remained on-site for two hours until the "all clear" was given. The policemen evacuated two nearby factory units. Total number of people evacuated was approximately 300. The smoke from the fire and the explosion drifted slowly (calm day) towards the nearby town of Shannon. It slowly dispersed over a number of hours. No smoke monitoring was carried out but the public was concerned.

Because of their familiarity with the plant and their long-standing liaison with the works fire team, the brigade had at least 20 monitors set up in record time. It was then a matter of maintaining water supplies while the plant could be depressurised sufficiently to allow temporary repairs. This critical stage lasted for about an hour. The flare stacks were used to vent down the alkylation plant. Eventually a mechanical clamp was attached to the pipe to seal it.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan was not activated.Emergency measures - Remarks: Automatic detectors, at the same time with a plant operator, sensed the gas leak and sounded the alarm (code 7106). The shift emergency controller activated the on-site emergency plan (code 7100) and the alkylation unit was isolated and depressurized (code 7104). The trained company fire fighters were employed (code 7107) in using fixed and portable water deluge monitors to aid the dispersion of the leaking gas (code 7102).

Lessons learned from the incident:Since it is possible the fire was caused by an exothermic chemical reaction of substances as a result of external contamination and the substances dripping from the stored containers, the operator took action to store hazardous materials in hazardous substance cabinets. The operating instructions for hazardous substance cabinets have been revised.
The main points are:- Contaminated containers must not be used;- Solvents/chemicals must be stored only in tightly sealed containers;- Ventilation grills on the hazardous substance cabinets must not be blocked;- Use drip trays made of non-combustible material under containers;- Packaging (cardboard, film) must not be stored in the hazardous substance cabinet as they constitute fire loads;- Monthly operational testing of extraction inside the cabinets.&amp;nbsp;
Lessons from the incident:Hazardous substance cabinets are usually designed to prevent fire from entering from the outside.The potential dangers from a fire started inside the cabinet are often overlooked in hazardous substance and risk assessments.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

alarm seems to be too high, giving in this instance at a typical
pumping rate of 8944 litres/ minute only 2 half minutes warning before
tank overtopping. Operators took in fact 11 half minutes to stop flow.
The high level alarm is not currently linked to a trip on the pump
itself. Ideally it should be.Measures to prevent recurrence: Daily manual dipping of tanks is now taking place and less reliance is being placed on tank gauges which, like any piece of plant, are subject to failure.  In any case, it seems clear that the tank's high level alarm should be repositioned to give much more warning of impending overfills.  Ideally, the high level alarm should be capable of tripping off the product pump.Measures to mitigate consequences: Once there, the consequences were dealt with well.Useful references: Information suggests that at least one other site, Kingsbury, high level alarms give much more warning and trip off the pump.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The incident came close to exceeding the containment volume, which could have resulted in pollution of the River Tyne. As the warehouse fire was well-established and the warehouse could not be saved, the fire service decided to allow the warehouse to burn rather than attempt fire fighting measures, and to concentrate on protecting adjacent plant and materials. Once the fire was safe to extinguish, and it was decided that it was possible to carry out some fire fighting without breaching the fire water containment, the fire fighting measures were taken. Running on-site effluent treatment assisted in this.Decontamination of the site and adjacent land was undertaken to remove asbestos released from the burning warehouse structure.Ecological surveys were undertaken to monitor environmental damage - none found.The damaged warehouse was demolished.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Changes are required to the emergency plan.There is a need to ensure that there is adequate fire water containment for the worst case scenario.

Before being discharged into the natural environment, the effluent is treated by large mobile units (filtration and coagulation/flocculation/decanting) starting from the fifth day (operating cost: EUR 0.5 m). Production has been slowed down in several sections on the site until the treatment plants are brought back into operation; one has been stopped, while the operation of two others has been reduced to 30-50%, resulting in high operating losses. Some of the effluent that feeds the biological treatment plant is being kept in storage in order to limit the organic load at the entrance to the plant. Medium-term surveillance of the environment has been put in place in order to assess the impact of the accident (ecotoxicological testing of Daphnia).

During the incident:Emergency tapping and shutdown of the blast furnace; Removal of the blockage in the area of the top closing device (bell).
After the incident:Adjustment of the bell control. In future, the bucket will only be released for lifting via the crane when the “Bell CLOSED” limit switch is fully reached, thus ensuring that the furnace head is completely closed. The interlocking of the release for lifting the bucket as long as both limit switches have not reached “Bell CLOSED” has been upgraded to SIL-1 quality as a PLT safety device.
Outside of the operating area:No further measures were necessary.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
The blockage of the blast furnace top closing device (bell) itself is suspected to have been caused by a larger object (chunk) in the blast furnace feed.


A systemic error was identified in the closing-device (bell) monitoring system, in that the charging skip was lifted by the blast furnace hoist during normal operation. This step in the process involved automated release by the programmable logic controller (PLC) by means of the closing-device monitoring system (system for monitoring the position of the bell), even though the blast furnace top closing device was not fully closed because of the blockage.

Analysis of the electronic closing-device monitoring system revealed that the ‘bell OPEN’ and ‘bell CLOSED’ limit switches had both been incorrectly programmed in the PLC.The ‘bell OPEN’ limit switch had been programmed in such a way that the blast furnace hoist was given clearance to lift the charging skip as soon as the bell left the ‘bell OPEN’ limit switch. This means that the charging skip could be lifted when the bell was still in the process of closing.This flaw, coupled with the fact that the bell had become blocked, led to the charging skip being lifted when the bell was not completely closed and could not close any more.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:A fire fighting team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the No 2 involved in the fire by means of water curtains.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:When the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident, preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started. At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out. The rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. Nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. A request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. The Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators. The ORSEC plan was activated and the decision to evacuate was made. Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers. Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00.Emergency measures - Remarks: The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened (code 7107). At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments (codes 7201 and 7103). The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 by means of water curtains (code 7102). At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started. At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres (code 7201) and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter (code 7203) and meteorological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (code 7109). At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted (code 7208) and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron (code 7109). The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made (code 7204). At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators (code 7201). At 14:15 the ORSEC plan was activated (code 7200) and at 14:30 the decision to evacuate was made (code7402). Public was notified by radio and by vehicles with loudspeakers (codes 7301 and 7302). Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people (code 7403). The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00 (code 7404). At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished.Discussion about response: At 08:00 four people started to work in the storage installation and, at 08:30, everything was normal. Some smoke was noticed by the storage personnel at about 09:15 am. The first reaction of the personnel was to use, unsuccessfully, portable fire extinguishers until the fire brigade intervened even if visible fire was never noticed. At 09:43 a 3 vehicle team arrived on-site and, after assessment of the situation, immediately requested a reinforcement with foam equipments. Fire fighting operations proceeded with difficulty owing to the yellow/red smoke cloud which had developed. The first attempt of the firemen was to isolate the ammonium nitrate in compartment No 5 from the compartment involved in the fire by means of water curtains. At 10:30 the toxicity danger due to smoke cloud became evident and at 11:15 preparations for the evacuation of an area affecting about 73,000 people started (shelter information to the public by vehicles with loudspeakers, telephone calls to town halls and through TV and local radio stations). At the same time, the number of fire fighting equipments was increased involving all the nearby safety centres and continuous monitoring of cloud movements by means of a helicopter and metereological indications given by the Nantes station were carried out (the concentrations of main pollutants [nitric acid, nitrogen oxides and ammonia] inside and outside the storehouse and at nearby communities as a function of time are available in the Original Report and the in relevant presentation in the Seminar on "The Notification of Major Accidents" held at Rethymnon Greece on October 6/7 in 1988). The toxic cloud reached an height of about 250m and was 5km large and it was covering a surface of about 15 km. At 11:30 the rail traffic between Nantes Le Croisis and Redon had been interrupted and preparation for evacuation in a radius of 1 km started. At 13:00 nitric acid concentrations of 5ppm were measured by the Nantes cell up to Coueron. The requisition of all public transport vehicles was made. At 13:50 a request to the army for assistance with vehicles was made. At 14:00 the Mobile Chemical Action Cell of Angers was asked for help and for a reserve of isolating respirators.

Schools, dance halls, sports hall were made available for receiving the evacuated people. During this period of time the products on fire were soaked with a total flow of 700m3/h. The fire was almost extinguished at 14:15 but emission of smoke was reduced considerably at 16:00 while reinforcement from other departments continued to arrive. At 17:20 the Prefect gave a Press Conference and at 18:00 a survey on the percentage evacuation achieved was undertaken. The rail traffic was resumed at 19:00 and population allowed to return home at 22:00. At 02:34 firemen penetrated inside the store and at 05:00 the fire was considered as extinguished. The ORSEC emergency plan terminated at 07:00.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The workers were evacuated as soon as the fire started. In total, 70 members of emergency services were involved.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The prevention and detection measures to be implemented aim at removing ignition sources and at detecting them as soon as possible if they should appear:1) more frequent cleaning of the vessel walls to avoid the formation of encrusted material2) installation of a filter on the fluidised bed heating equipment to avoid generating hot particles3) although the mechanism is not fully understood, the principal parameters governing the risk of exothermic reactions are the temperature, the amount of substance present, and the presence of iron. The preventive measures are therefore: reduction of temperature at start-up, detection of accumulation of substance by installing sensors, not stocking the product in iron vessels, and avoiding the re-injection into the process of recycled water, which can have a high sulphur content.The protection measures rely on the materials used in the installation being non-inflammable. It is therefore proposed:&amp;nbsp;- that the first stage of the water washer and the ventilation ducts be built of non-inflammable material&amp;nbsp;- that rapid-closing valves be installed between the fluidised bed vaporiser and the water washer (this is also to be applied to other vaporisers connected to the washer)&amp;nbsp;- to review the location of the final product storage silos in relation to the water washer.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The existing gas detection at the storage area managed to stop the leak successfully in a short time. However, the activation of this detection depended on the wind direction, which was in this case favorable.
Emergency shutdown buttons should be available on all escape routes.
The existing railhooks managed to close off the railcars succesfully. It would be better if these railhooks were equipped with detection (for example pneumatically), interlocked to the loading operation.
Safety interlocks (such as the derailing hook) should be constructed in a way that bypassing them is only possible with specialised tools.
Provisions must be taken to allow for easy cooling of railcars with flammable liquified gasses on all sides. It is advisable to implement a fixed water spray system ("deluge").
Management of change procedures should also include changes of the used equipment and the procedures.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The off-site Emergency plan was activated and the population sheltered-in-place as a protective measure. The product residues and the extinguishing water were disposed of according to the indications of the Catalunya waste agency.Emergency measures - Remarks: On request of the Catalunya Waste Agency the company collected the contaminated ground area, 25 m3, and sent it to an authorised company for disposal.Post accident evaluation; the off-site emergency plan did not consider the scenario of a fire with smoke containing a certain percentage of chlorine; scenarios of accidents caused by the release of chlorine and the formation of a toxic cloud were considered. These accident scenarios foresaw much more serious consequences than those of the actual accident which occurred. </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence:The Department for Industry of Catalunya, competent in this field, proposed a series of corrective measures, which will not be applied to this installation because, as planned, dismantling operations of the plant started end of July 2003. The issue of a series of general guidelines for installations producing or handling the same product or similar substances will be studied.The following conclusions were drawn from the accident:·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The use of the transit area as a storage area appears to be negligent with regards to safety and was worsened by the following factors:-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Significant amounts (54 tons/day before the accident) of product stored in a small area practically exposed to atmospheric conditions.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The product safety sheet indicates that exposing the product to humidity and temperatures above 40°C should be avoided-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Irregular storage duration: three months.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Lack of specific fire fighting equipment for the area.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Design of the area, the cable racks were suspended at a height of 7 meters from the ground but the piles of product reached a height of 3.5 meters.·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Operative procedures and safety management system. Unsafe practices:-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Failure to recover the spilled product with the intention to postpone the operation to the next day.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Leaving a fork lift truck near the big bags with the risk associated to the presence of fuel.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;There were no written procedures on the measures to be taken in case of the rupture of a bag and product spill, although it appears that the workers knew that they had to be careful during product recovery and that contaminated products had to be sent for disposal.·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;According to the workers bag ruptures were frequent. Moreover they all report&amp;nbsp; having seen sodium dichlorisocyanurate react with trichlorocyanuric acid (TCCA) with fuel or water in the processing area. Consequently although risks were known the safety measures taken were not sufficiently effective.·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The installation did not comply with the regulations set out by the current legislation according to the results of the inspections foreseen for Major Accident Hazard installations, although the non-compliance did not concern classified substances. Although the operator was still within the terms for the corrective measures set out following the inspection, but not all of them, it has to be said that this does not exempt the operator from the exclusive responsibility with regards to the non-compliance with the applicable regulations as from the date these regulations were implemented in Spanish law.Measures to mitigate consequences: The lack of an extinguishing water system independent of the process, although not obligatory, associated with the failure of the electric cable system led to the plant not being able to respond to the emergency&amp;nbsp; with its own means, having&amp;nbsp; to depend completely on external emergency response services and fire brigades.Alternative systems are being studied.Useful references:The medical services reported that no patients were treated for the effects of the toxic cloud but complaints concerning irritation to eyes and respiratory tract were received by local police officers of adjacent municipalities and by the emergency number 112. This leads us to suppose that the smoke cloud was at such a height not to affect the population of the rural area nearest to the plant, in which there are farm buildings. When the smoke cooled down and reached the ground it was sufficiently diluted not to cause any severe health consequences to people.The fact that the population living in the vicinity was alerted and requested to take shelter in their homes and to close doors and windows certainly contributed to reducing the consequences of this event.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The DRIRE launched an immediate administrative inquiry on 26 June 2004. Numerous contacts were made and meetings and dialogues organized by the departments in charge of the regulation of pressurized systems and those in charge of environmental questions, both local and regional.With a view to identifying the causes of this accident and taking the steps for restarting the HDS unit without risk, a Prefectoral order prescribing emergency measures, dated 30 June 2004, was communicated to the operator at the instigation of the DRIRE.Analysis of failures and causes:An examination of the chronology of the event (recordings of the alarm, of sensors, movements of valves, etc.), a description of possible advance indications and the list of special operations carried out in the course of the day were presented. Essentially, the following points emerge:- no irregularity in the process parameters before the accident and no warning sign is revealed by the analysis of the operation parameters of the HDS unit,- no malfunction in the automatic control and safety devices (independent systems) was identified.The failures and causes analysis was carried out by a multidisciplinary internal working group. The work session was steered by an expert guaranteeing the correct application of the fault-tree model, and who had not been involved in the management of the accident in question.Plant:- Checks and inspections were carried out on the equipment of the reactor loop downstream from the oven (reactor 42R202, exchangers 42E201 and 42E202A/B) which suffered abrupt decompression when the tube of the oven ruptured, although normal operation provides for the application of a very gradual depressurization procedure. Because of this, the internal cladding coatings (an internal cladding skin applied to the welding seams) or stainless steel double skins could have suffered a phenomenon of adhesion failure (disbonding by the hydrogen). No such anomaly was revealed.- the chimney, which had flames issuing from its top for several minutes, was subjected to thermographic checks, visual inspections of the crown by telescope and verification of verticality. It results that the concrete structure and its internal cladding (refractory brick) are in satisfactory condition and in conformity with construction specifications.- 34 lines were checked: o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the pipework in zones 5 and 6, mainly the combustible and utility supplies to the oven, were replaced or eliminated (the new oven changed over to fuel gas only),o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; the loading and transfer lines of the oven situated in zone 5, together with all the pipework on the eastern rack and on the ground were not metallurgically affected by the fire because of their heat-insulation protection. The remedial work consisted of replacement of the bolting, joints, heat insulation and its protective metal sheeting, and the spring supports, - all the electrical cabling and measurement systems were completely overhauled, with replacement of damaged components,- all the valves and pumps were overhauled,- the water curtain systems of ovens 42F201 and 42F501 were entirely rebuilt, - the gas detectors were overhauled and replaced where necessary.- In view of the extent of the damage to the oven, the decision was taken to rebuild it new together with the associated civil engineering works (concrete support columns, first section of the flue). The reconstruction was almost identical to the original, though the following improvements were incorporated: o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6 burners fitted instead of 4, enabling better distribution of the heat flow,o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; remote ignition device for the burners included,o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; temperature sensors fitted on the outer skins of the tubes at two levels in the radiation part, and similarly on the lower layer of the convection part, for the purpose of monitoring any abnormal temperature increases that might be caused by build-up of coke in the inside,o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; inclusion of supplementary man holes.Inspection plan:The inspection plan of the oven was revised to take into account the initial conclusions drawn from the expert examination, and provides for the following additional checks, made possible by the new design of the equipment: On the convection part:o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; replica tests and radiography of the convection tubes once per cycle, o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007 (after 25 000 h of operation): measurements of thickness of the tubes of the lower layer and 20 % of the peripheral elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), radiography (to look for internal corrosion and the presence of coke),o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes.On the radiation part:o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; checks of thickness on 20% of the tubes and elbows at each annual shut-down (replacement of the reactor catalyst),o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; at the next major shut-down in 2007: measurements of thickness of the tubes and elbows, geometrical calibration of the tubes (to look for creep), metallographic replica tests on tubes at two different heights (to look for sensitization of the stainless steel),o&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; continuous monitoring of the skin temperature of the tubes at two heights.The inspections and periodic requalifications will be accompanied by verification of the safety accessories and the requalification of a hydraulic test.Passivation procedure:An internal working group was set up to re-examine the passivation procedure and the equipment likely to be concerned.Feedback from experience on other equipment or other units:There are no other desulphuration ovens on the site that could display this type of corrosion.According to the operator, the aggression by polythionic acids could also occur on the catalytic reformer, as also in unit HDT2 (hydrogen treatment) where, as a consequence of the geometrical constraints, passivation is not feasible. The DRIRE has nevertheless asked the operator to conduct more intensive investigations of these units to look for the possible&amp;nbsp; presence of this phenomenon of corrosion.Examination of the accident case histories involving ovens in refineries (ARIA database compiled by BARPI) did not identify any similar accident (June 2005).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The accident is a reminder of the importance of certain problems relating to such aspects as detection, response (Onsite Emergency Response Plan), external communication and the limitations of the inspection plan of the installations.Detection and response:In the absence of fire detection on the HDS unit, staff who were present working on a neighbouring were able to raise the alarm very quickly and activate means of decompression and cooling of the in the next 5 minutes. This favourable circumstance must not be allowed to obscure the crucial importance of rapid detection of such an event, which conditions the time lag before the response of staff and the activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. Thus, in view of the reduction in numbers of staff in the immediate proximity of the installations for obvious safety raisons (a programme of construction of new control rooms remote from the units is in progress), the detection of accidental occurrences in the production units (detection of fire, gas, etc.) and the visual and auditory surveillance of the installations must be re-examined, without prejudice to the monitoring of the operating parameters.A study group was set up to clarify the modes of activation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan. The occurrence of 26 June 2004 has indeed raised questions regarding the formal implementation of the Onsite Emergency Response Plan.It is also worth asking certain questions regarding the balance between the staff allocated to the production units and those needed for emergency response operations in case of an accident occurring. This aspect takes on particular importance outside working hours.In view of the human consequences of the fire of 26 June 2004, the decision was taken, at the request of the CHSCT, to repair the paving of the HDS unit. It would seem desirable to extend this measure to the whole of the plant.Inspection plan:The rupture of the tube that started the fire was a consequence of certain types of deterioration (coke deposit, attack by polythionic acids), which were not identified when the inspection plan was drawn up with the aid of the RBeye software program used by the Group.Further development of this tool would thus seem necessary so that it includes the modes of deterioration mentioned above and to take the age of the equipment into account in the criticality calculations. Deterioration of the tubes may also become apparent during hydraulic strength tests, provided the equipment is subjected to greater stresses than those occurring in normal service. If the initial strength test applied to the oven newly rebuilt in accordance with the decree of 13 December 1999 is suitable for addressing this concern, steps should be taken to ensure that this condition applies for similar ageing equipment.To verify the relevance of these measures, it might be interesting to make a comparison of the inspection plans for these units currently implemented in French refineries.External communication:During the crisis management operations, the information given by the operator concerning the gravity and the potential consequences of the accident, were considered as to be inadequate by the offsite services (Town Hall, Police, Emergency Response Services, Director of Sports Infrastructures, etc.).The operator, on the other hand, considers that the measures taken by the Authorities where exaggerated with regards to the nature of the occurrence. In terms of communication, a press conference was held by the director of the site on 26 June 2004 , the day of the accident, at 18.30.These diverging evaluations were examined after the event in a debriefing meeting at the Prefecture of the Rhône, which concluded that there was a need: - to improve the organization of crisis management between the Town Hall of Feyzin, the Police Authorities and the refinery,- for the operator, to formalize in his alert procedures the notion of "events visible from the outside", comprising a fast, systematic means of informing the Authorities, even in cases where the Onsite Emergency Plan is not activated.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

In 2015, stared the procedure for reviewing the permit. The Minister's decision is cancel the Seveso permit in 2016, which the operator appeals against. By Decision No. 10349 of 03.08.2018, the appeal of Videx AD against Decision No. 62/2016 was dismissed and entered into force on 29.11.2018. As a result of this the operator was obliged to reduce the total quantity of hazardous substances available on the site may not exceed the threshold quantities of 50 tonnes of explosive substances alone and in the composition of articles. From 2015-2018 discharge (disposal, delaboration) was suspended, no production activity was allowed and is not expected to be renewed in the future. At the end of 2018, the procedure for removal of ammunition received for utilisation from the Republic of Greece was completed - 190 570 mines were exported back. Videx AD took measures to release&amp;nbsp; explosives and ammunition available on the site. Currently on the cite , explosive substances and articles owned by other companies are available.
Measures to prevent reocurrence: 1. The training of the personnel had been reviewed and improved; 2. The inspection procedures of the maintenance personnel had been reviewed and improved; 3. An annual report on the safety management system had been developed; 4. Improvements of the safety management system had been made; 5. The safety report and the risk assessment had been updated
Measures to mitigate consequences. After the accident the following measures had been established: 1. Simple and efficient emergency response procedures had been developed; 2. Improvements to the emergency plan had been made.
At the moment the safety report is not approved by the competent authority.

The fact of accidental opening of the valve was not discovered on the spot (happened at 21:02) and was therefore not blocked. The workers left the working area in a hurry.&amp;nbsp;
As an immediate measure, the&amp;nbsp;shift supervisor instructed the system operators to shut down the technology&amp;nbsp;(closing the chlorine and carbon-monoxide valves, and setting the blowdown to 100%).&amp;nbsp;
The&amp;nbsp;shift supervisor&amp;nbsp;and the other system operator went back to the working area where they completed the paddle blind removal (they already had a crowbar, so they succeeded).&amp;nbsp;
They realised that the remote-operated pneumatic valve was partially opened. Afterward, the shift supervisor checked the status of this pneumatic ball valve on the PLC screen. It displayed failure while receiving a closing command.
The valve was then closed remotely. The closed stage was displayed at 21:15 on the screen.&amp;nbsp;
The installed gas detection system detected phosgene presence from 21:00 to 21:05.
After the accident, neither the shift supervisor nor the system operators notified the emergency service, which would have been mandatory by the regulations. They neither notified the relevant managers - except one person, the plant engineer (who has been called at 21:55). The plant engineer, who was at home, also did not notify other managers or the emergency service. The relevant managers were not informed of the accident until the next morning, at the beginning of the shift.&amp;nbsp;
The trainee system operator, apart from coughing, appeared to be in a good condition. Also, he verified that he is not feeling unwell. In the control room, the system operators and the shift supervisor questioned the trainee system operator if he needed first aid, but he did not request it, so they did not notify the emergency service.
As a basic treatment,&amp;nbsp;the trainee system operator&amp;nbsp;was continuously inhaling ethanol, but the available oxygen respiratory support device was not used. Professional medical treatment started too late, and hours later the contamination.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After investigating the causes, the operator took the following measures:

a trainee worker should not work in the presence of a toxic gas until becomes confident in carrying out tasks in a safe condition,
out-of-turn training for workers,
out-of-turn inspection of the relevant valve and process unit,
review of the occupational risk assessment,

At the Prefect's request, a team of fire-fighters from the neighbouring mine, specialised in operating underground, also fought the fire but without success.Any action where the fire occurred could only be by operatives using independent protection equipment bearing in mind, in addition, that the temperature at the bottom of the mine was of the order of 32°C (these constraints limit the length of each firefighting session to a maximum of 30 min and make necessary the presence of a standby response crew on the surface to act if needed).On 20 September, there was an inspection which concluded that the fire was out, without however prejudging the possible persistence of hot spots, subsequently confirmed by ongoing measurements made in the block by means of an automatic sampler. As the hot spots persisted, work to inject nitrogen designed to "inert" the atmosphere in the block and thus extinguish the last seats of combustion took place between 23 and 25 October.At later inspections, it was found that there were still some hot spots. On 7 November, further extinguishing was undertaken by injecting nitrogen to the heart of the few seats that were still active.On 12 November, the fire was considered to be totally out.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The internal emergency plan was launched, with the activation of alarms, the shutdown of the plant, and the start-up of fixed cooling systems. The internal emergency squad was called out. At the same time the gatekeeper, as planned in the emergency procedure, called out the local Fire Brigade, ambulances, and police. After about 15 minutes, therefore,the external emergency plan was put into effect, involving primarily: the Fire Brigade, who took over the operations of fire extinguishing and containment; the police, who directed local traffic, blocked the Provincial road, and as a precaution also evacuated houses and offices immediately round the plant; and the ambulance service, called in to help those hurt.Seveso II duties  - remarks: Concerning points c) and d), for
which the default "no" has deliberately been indicated, it should be
noted that the transposition of Directive 96/82/EC is recent, and for
existing establishments there are transitory arrangements up to 2001.
It will be possible to supply the specific response when the relevant
inspections have been carried out. These inspections will be arranged
once the Ministry for the Environment, in accordance with Art. 18 of
the Directive and will look in particular at the state of
implementation of the safety management system intended to prevent
major accidents.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Since investigations into the cause of the accident are still going on, no particular further safety measures have yet been taken. Considering, however, the results of the accident, there would appear in the first instance to be a need for better - perhaps automatic - control of the temperature within the tank, with provision for the steam supply to be interrupted if the temperature rises above the safety value. It would also be useful to have written procedures defining the operators' actions for the drainage sequence.Measures to mitigate consequences: Considering that the cloud expanded over the highway, and that this was probably the source of ignition, the company are considering whether the carry out such drainage operations on tanker further away from the roadside.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The lessons that can be learnt from this are:– A change of operator and associated technical and organisations changes can have a considerable impact on plant safety. Of particular importance are aspects concerning plant integrity (inspection, upkeep and maintenance). The impact on safety may not become apparent for a considerable time. The safety management system must also take into consideration organisational changes. It is recommended that such organisational changes are also taken into consideration by the authorities in conjunction with supervision.– A lack of coordination of regular inspection and testing measures may lead to incorrect interpretations when assessing the state of the equipment.– Clear findings with written descriptions and images are therefore required in order to establish the scope and detail of the inspection and the methods used. The inspection report (results) should contain a comprehensible description of the inspection carried out and an expert opinion. In particular, the results of visual inspections should be explained.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The above analysis of causes suggests that the existing precautionary measures are as effective as possible. We still cannot completely rule out the risk of human error in the future.Additional checks on the final assembly would further reduce the risk. The high level of specialisation of the contracted assembly company means that the top priority is in improved quality control within the assembly company, which is largely outside the control of the facility operator. The facility operator has indeed increased its general vigilance with regard to work done by external companies. The staff’s long years in the job should be particularly helpful in allowing them to use their experience to prevent risks in the future.Measures were taken to limit the impact, but it was not possible to prevent injury to the secondary fermenter. The materials used have now been given a fire-resistant finish (films) where possible. This is another constructive safeguard that may limit the effects of damage in the event of a future incident.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

This has already been achieved by implementing an automatic switch to the back-up controller (with appropriate visualisation) in the event of an error in the standard system as an ad hoc measure.&amp;nbsp;
During planned standstills in summer 2017, two additional pressure transmitters will be installed on the blast furnace gas risers. Their analogue readings will then be transmitted directly to the back-up controller as a 4-20 mA signal. The back-pressure can thus be controlled by the back-up controller independently of the SPS on the basis of separate measurements of the pressure in the risers.
The analogue data signals from the four existing pressure transmitters on the risers will also be routed via four independent isolation amplifiers in order to decouple the signals.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The seal on the soda tank lid was checked and the tank pumping procedure modified to avoid the opening of the lid. Other procedures were formalised or consolidated, namely:
- instructions in case of activation of the unit's technical safety barriers: conductivity meter, pressure sensor, etc.;
- Bypass of the unit's technical barriers: awareness-building for both technical staff and managers, definition of each team member's roles and responsibilities, clarification and restriction of authorised bypass conditions;
- Conditions applicable to unit technician certification regarding both process safety and equipment inspection;
- Frequency of conductivity meter calibration (shortened from 6 to 3 months);
- Formalisation of information/feedback loops among operations teams and the online analyser maintenance department.
The Classified Facilities Inspectorate asked the site operator to review the criteria adopted for activating the internal emergency plan and better inform staff of the role played by technical safety barriers, as even backup barriers did not justify bypassing a barrier without first analysing the compensatory measures that would eventually need to be implemented.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The on-site emergency plan was activated involving the nearby refinery, with monitoring of the gas cloud, the off-site emergency plan was activated involving the fire brigade, the prefecture, the municipality and the police forces, the personnel not needed for the emergency response operations were evacuated.Emergency measures - Remarks: The first emergency measure taken by the on-site emergency response service and the emergency response personnel of the neighbouring installations Saras and Polimeri Europa was to dilute and confine the gas cloud with water sprays. In particular the personnel of Saras stationed themselves externally on the southern part with monitors and installed water curtains fed by the refinery water network, while the personnel of Polimeri Europa positioned themselves externally on the eastern part of the installation with sprays fed by with a water tender.The first fire brigade team arrived at 8:05 hrs and substituted the personnel of the installation in the response operations.Subsequently water was pumped through the pipe coming from the Saras refinery, usually used for transferring LPG from the refinery into the storage tanks. The water was pumped at a higher pressure than the pressure inside the tank (approximately 5 kg/cm2), so as to displace the LPG in the bottom of the tank and substitute it in the leakage.This measure allowed&amp;nbsp; the surrounding area to be made secure by 9:30 hrs and to approach the ruptured valve and seal it by 10:00 hrs.The LPG remaining in the tank was then transferred to another adjacent tank.The off-site emergency plan was activated.Discussion about response: The environmental conditions in which the accident developed were such that the employment of all foreseen emergency response means was possible, thus avoiding the evolution of the accident event.
The accident analysis showed that pumping water into the tank was a very effective measure. 
The accident was caused by the rupture of a ball valve shaft installed on the liquid outlet pipe of the tank which was ejected from its seat while opening the valve. The valve had been installed at the time the installation was built, 35 years earlier; therefore the substitution of these valves should be more frequent.
</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate Lessons: Similar valves were substituted also on the other tanks, the new valves installed have an improved safety design (better technology), the refurbishing operations of the installation were brought forward.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Orally, the team leaders evacuated the transhipment hall. A team leader entered the trailer of the truck to check the damage. The team leaders then fitted mask cartridges and boots in order to intervene in the truck. These internal intervention team entered the truck, placed the damaged drum in a oversized drum, took it out of the truck and scattered sand on the spill in the truck. The oversized drum was closed and placed at the entrance hall outside. Some of the liquid was found in the drain beneath the loading docks, the drain is connected to the retention basin.The prevention advisor then arrived on the spot. The intervention team proceeded then to the identification of the product in the drum: it was a drum in transit (arrived on 23/05/2011, stored temporarily in the hall and departure on 24/05/2011), the only information available on the product was those listed on the CMR (but the CMR was not directly available) and on the label on the drum itself. The product name, piperidine, was then spotted on the barrel itself. The prevention advisor then searched the MSDS in the computer system via a computer in the administrative office of the transhipment hall, but without success and then via internet, but without success also because Internet access was not possible . He then went into the main administrative offices located at the other end of the site. He returned with the MSDS of the product found on the Internet.In consultation with the internal intervention team, it was decided not to continue the intervention (dilution and removal of the remaining product with water to the fire retention pond), but to call to the external fire departement.A security perimeter was internally created (notably to prevent truck access to the site).The prevention advisor welcomed the firefighters and provided the link with the emergency services. Firefighters then established their command post.The chemical intervention cell was deployed by the fire departement and an intervention strategy was put in place: two firemen equipped with chemical proof overalls and breathing apparatus was then sent into the truck in reconnaissance, before setting up the actual response : cleaning the truck, rinsing and dilution.A security perimeter was set up by police around the site during these operations.It remained necessary to remove the diluted product that was collected in the retention pond: there was a consultation with the client on residual risks of the product diluted with water and finally a test was performed on a sample of the mixture water + product to determine if the mixture was still flammable. As this was not the case, the mixture could be pumped into a tanker truck and then be removed.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">More consistent formation of temporary workersNo more temporary workers put the first day to work during night shiftsBetter access on safety information about the products in transit: all goods in transit warehouses are not accompanied by an MSDS. Only security Tremcards are available. These include very general safety instructions and not always accompany the goods (Tremcards are stored in the cabin of the vehicle). This finding is similar for all goods in transit through the territory. Therefore, in case of intervention, research on the internet (very common product in this case) of the MSDS seems like a good solution.More consistant training module for all the staff presenting the hazards of chemicals and including a detailed explanation of personal protective equipment needed in case of intervention and an explanation of the methods of dressing upMore specific training module for intervention crew, including detailed explanation of the MSDS and consultation of MSDS via the stock program and detailed explanations of response procedures</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

All work at the plant stopped after the accident. The building and the cap loading line room was shut down in order to secure the work environment and the forthcoming accident investigation. The police then took control over the building to investigate the accident according to the Penal Code and the Work Environment Act.
Orica's local crisis management team was mobilized immediately. Their task is to facilitate cooperation between the authorities and to support the staff and the society under such circumstances.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Orica has focused the measures to make the handling of the explosives safer, improve the instructions and increase the staffs’ awareness of the importance to follow instructions and the possible consequences. &amp;nbsp;
Friction, Impact, Static, and Heat (FISH) events with sufficient energy to cause detonation need to be identified and eliminated. Note that energy from FISH events required to initiate primary and secondary explosives is significantly lower than that for Packaged Explosives products and intermediates.
Energetic Material: All equipment that contains/has contained energetic material must be removed and cleansed of all energetic material prior to undertaking:

any maintenance work on process equipment at all Initiating Systems (IS) plants; and
hot work on equipment at any plant.

This has for instance involved improvements such as:

Changed metal parts on the equipment to plastic to avoid metal to metal.
No tools are required to open, change or adjust the dosage of the explosives. It can be done with pinches.

Independent verification and sign-off is required prior to commencing the work described above.
Permits: Any work required on Initiating Systems equipment (whether by maintenance or operations) that contains/has contained energetic material, if that work could result in any FISH event (e.g. use of metal tools, any heat source), must be treated as 'hot work' and must be authorised through the site’s Hot Work Permit process.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

At around 10.00am the trickle of petrol from the tank was getting smaller and it eventually stopped. At this point no more water was pumped into the tank.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">---Lessons Learned drawn from the FD_38831_Le Grand Quevilly_DP_vfin_GB.pdf report ----Even though the severity of this accident remained rather mild given the absence of domino effects, several lessons can still be drawn, relative to both the causes and circumstances.As for causes, this accident highlights two significant organisational flaws :• Deficiency in the control of equipments materials at the time of unit installation. Even though material certificates were verified by an independent control body according to the operator, the steel used on the bottom and 12 other pieces of equipment was not compliant with specifications, and the original pipe construction documentation could never be found.• Incomplete traceability of pipe monitoring given that until 2003, formalisation of the steam pipe condition monitoring protocol had only been partial (restricted to unit drawings). Formalisation of monitoring procedures was not initiated before the first periodic recertification, in application of the 15 March 2000 decree, though the unit had already been operating for 25 years. Nonetheless, the French regulation relative to plant pipelines (issued on 23rd January, 1962) stipulated in Article 13 that "the documents, drawings or diagrams, testing and retesting reports, notes from inspections prescribed in Article 12, relative to a pipeline or set of pipelines, are to be archived…".From a broader perspective, this accident stresses the difficulties found by the internal and external control entities in detecting such non-compliance in steel. As demonstrated in the inventory of all unit’s pipes, this non-compliance does not represent an isolated case. It would be useful to mention that a verification of the steel quality had taken place in 1987 but was limited to those elements prone to hot hydrogen damages. Even if the initial recertification had been conducted in compliance with current regulations (without any imposed hydraulic test, no imposed exposure, original drawings forwarded to the authorised certification body), the question can still be raised whether it was reasonable to limit this verification to just the regulatory control steps in the absence of construction specifications. The organisation of these controls, shared over time among several distinct actors (internal inspection team, certified control authorities and the various external firms subcontracted to perform specific tasks), was not designed to promote efficient monitoring given the lack of rigour in their formalisation.The operator also conducted verifications on the type of materials found on the most sensitive parts of the site's other units. The local environmental authority requested an operator of similar units located just a few kilometres away to undertake the same kind of verification. Feedback was addressed at the national level to all local environmental authority offices.As regards the consequences of this accident, it can be considered that a 40-kg steel projectile propelled through an operating ammonia production unit, passing close to an NH3 receiving bottle, missing the nitric acid unit and a bulk ammonium nitrate conveyor belt only to land in a zone where railcars loaded with ammonia were likely to park, all while causing relatively minor property damage, lies within the realm of “divine intervention”. This assessment was underscored in a letter written by the local environmental authority to the operator: "… the caps, which are massive pieces of equipment weighing some forty kilograms, most likely crossed the most sensitive installations found in the AM2 unit, namely the R1501 bottle, to ultimately land between 2 railway lines at the location of switch 371. These elements attest to the potential seriousness of this incident…".This potential seriousness was also fully perceived by the operator, with some testimonials suggesting that some plant employees became aware of the risks related to pressurised steam. It goes without saying that the site's safety reports were focused on the most common hazardous phenomena for this kind of activity, as well as those causing potential effects outside the site boundaries, though domino effects caused by pressurised steam equipments were not included.The scenario with most third-party exposure is based on a toxic ammonia leak (up to an 8-km radius around the site).This scenario recently became more predominant in employees mind given the repetition of accidents of this type arising just a short time earlier at one of the Group's sister facilities located less than 200 km from Grand Quevilly (three months before the accident : ARIA 38959; and one year before with the evacuation of 300 employees receiving significant media attention : ARIA 36660).Besides, a flaw in the implementation of instructions issued by the internal inspection team has to be pointed out.Following the incident that occurred in October 2009, when the water hammer associated with a restart had caused the rupture of a bleed valve on one of the unit's high-pressure pipes, this team had requested that the pipe inspection plan incorporate the mode of vibration-induced degradation. Eight months later, on the day of the accident, this mode had still not been included even though it would have perhaps allowed to detect the surface defect or the onset of microcracking at the level of the weld (had for example a magnafluxing inspection been carried out on the suspected weld).On the other hand and despite the communication efforts engaged by the site operator and authorities over major accidents behaviour in the past few years, this potentially serious outcome has gone unnoticed by all neighbours. Several local residents actually went onto their balconies to observe the actions of fire-fighters, while others walked up to the site boundary even though safety guidelines called for residents to remain indoors.In defence of local residents, the operator's decision to activate the internal emergency plan would have alerted them to the potential seriousness of the incident. Instead, the operator waited for 50 minutes before triggering this emergency plan jointly with the municipality and local authorities. Fire-fighters were notified well before this period, but this notification came from local residents calls, and fire-fighting crews were unaware of the exact situation when they arrived at 11:30 pm in front of the site. Moreover, the decision made at 11:15 pm not to activate the emergency siren on the grounds of an absence of toxic leaks only further sparked the curiosity of some residents upon hearing the leaking steam noise between 11:07 and 11:27 pm, inciting them to get closer to the site. In reality, the operator could not have been completely certain of the absence of toxic leaks until around 12:18 am, after the second inspection of the damaged unit and negative controls of air toxicity around the site. A final inspection of the unit with authority representatives was even considered necessary at 1:15 am to remove any lingering doubts.Alerting local residents and requesting them to remain indoors, even if not really necessary, would have provided the added benefit of reminding residents that a major accident can occur and would have tested their ability to apply correctly the preventive guidelines.In conclusion, the operator was late in informing local emergency response teams and neighbouring municipalities, which were unable to notify individuals with information regarding the accident, a shortcoming that further incited the inappropriate reaction of some residents. And yet the plant's locality happened to be one of the few in France to be equipped with an automated call system to quickly and simultaneously alert residents living near the site.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

 2) Pipelines should be installed primarily overground.
 3) Undergrowth should be removed from under pipelines and pipelines should be installed in such height that snow doesn't cause any harm. 
4) Pipeline tunnels should be taken into account when organizing pipeline maintenance. 
5) In order to isolate a part of  a long pipeline, it should be equipped with additional valves, which could be closed in emergency situations.  
6) Detailed procedures should be made for carrying out periodic inspections.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After the accident happened, the Company's organic plant production was immediately shut down to reduce the discharge of pollutants to Longjiang River. Local firefighters used a large amount of water to put out fires, but because the firefighting wastewater was too much, it caused a great threat to the water quality of the River. In order to avoid the secondary pollution caused by the firefighting wastewater, the emergency command center took the following measures in light of the actual situation: 1) pumped the wastewater directly into a newly built but not used wastewater treatment pool to be stored there temporarily; and 2) built four activated carbon dams using angle irons and wooden stakes as skeleton materials in the downstream of the sewage ditch. A total of 14.1t activated carbon was placed in the dams to adsorb pollutants in the wastewater. However, the emergency pool of the Company's organic plant did not work normally and no emergency levee was built, some chemical materials flowed along with firefighting wastewater into Longjiang River through the total discharge outlet of the plant. The emergency command center immediately asked the environmental emergency monitoring team to set up 5 fixed points and 1 mobile monitoring point at the total discharge outlet and the downstream sections of Longjiang River to monitor water quality and to track the head of the pollution belt in the river. They monitored the water quality once per hour. The environmental emergency monitoring team set up 3 atmospheric monitoring points in the downwind area from the accident site to monitor air quality. All these monitoring results provided strong support for the emergency command center to make decisions.
At 8:40 that morning, the emergency command center issued No.1 Notification to evacuate people within 5km from the accident site to ensure the life and safety of the Company's staff and nearby residents. At 11:10 am, it issued No.2 Notification to prohibit drinking any water taken from the downstream sections of Longjiang River below the accident site and notified various cage culture fishermen in Longjiang River to relocate their fish to safe watercourses. At the same time, it phoned to Liuzhou County's Environmental Protection Bureau to inform them of the accident situation to ensure the drinking water safety of people downstream. Because of timely notification, downstream residents of Figure Case-2-1 Scene of the incident site Annex 1 Eight Selected Chemical Accident Reports from China Longjiang River stopped fetching drinking water from the river; instead they got their drinking water from other water sources to solve the drinking water issue.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Between 02:45 and 09:00, at a plastics factory classified as an upper-tier Seveso establishment, vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) was released from a VCM degassing and condensation circuit. At 02:25, a valve in the degassing circuit opened. Between 02:45 and 04:45, the low-level alarm of the gas meter was activated and the compressors shut down. At the same time, the VCM readings on the chromatography detectors in a workshop where the degassing reactors are located showed concentrations of between 5 and 10 ppm. The operators noted that the valves of 2 autoclaves were leaking. They tightened the valves and made a request for maintenance. Around 08:00, a spike of 12&amp;nbsp;ppm of VCM was detected in the roof area of a laboratory near the condensation unit. The control room was confined. At 08:50, the day shift noticed billows above the degassing section. At 09:00, the teams on duty manually closed the valve in question, which had been left open. The release of VCM was stopped.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The operator will make all the operating teams aware of this incident and of the action plan prepared on the basis of the cause-consequence analysis made after the incident. In particular, it intends to:

check ‘sensitive’ equipment capable of causing VCM to be released into the atmosphere, carry out a HAZOP analysis of the systems in which they are integrated, set in place specific monitoring of this equipment and systematically launch an incident report if there is a malfunction involving this equipment. Additional actions may be identified on completion of the HAZOP analysis, such as checking that the equipment is used in accordance with suppliers’ recommendations;
make the operating teams aware of the need to carry out incident reporting and use the lessons learned from this incident to make recommendations for the future;
add alarms on valves that may lead to a release of VCM;
review and create different ‘alarm data sheets’ to cover situations that, until now, have rarely or never occurred on the site.
standardise the process monitoring software in order to identify potential failures more easily;
add information on the schematic diagrams and on the screens in the control room;
update the procedure for alerting the site’s standby staff.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Emergency measures - Remarks: The ConocoPhillips Emergency Response Team led the fire-fightiing effort with the Humberside Fire Service attending; fire crew from an adjacent oil refinery also assisted them as part of the existing mutual aid scheme. 

The incident occurred at 14.21 hours and the refinery general alarm was sounded shortly afterwards. At 14.40 the refinery was shut down because the fire appeared to be out of control. By approximately 15.30 the fire was under control and it was largely extinguished by 17.10 and recorded by the Humberside Fire Service as 'struck out' at 21.01 hours.

The off-site emergency alarm (Community Alarm) was not sounded at any point during the incident. ConocoPhillips view is that this off-site emergency alarm is only used for foreseen toxic gas releases. The damage caused from the incident was immediate and without warning. The off-site emergency plan was not put into effect. Following the investigation, recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.

In addition to the Humberside Fire Service, the other emergency services committed significant resources to tackle the incident; Police closed off roads around the refinery, nearby residents were informed to close windows and remain indoors, ambulances were summoned to the site and the local Hospital instigated its major incident procedure. Whilst the property damage in the area was extensive, fortunately there were no serious injuries.
Seveso II duties  - remarks: Although there was an
off-site emergency plan for this establishment, it was not initiated in
response to this incident. There was also uncertainty as to who was
responsible for calling the emergency services.
Following the investigation it was recommended that:

a) the procedures should be reviewed to clarify who calls the emergency
services, which services should be contacted and the circumstances
under which they should be called. All documents and call lists should
be revised as appropriate.

b) the circumstances under which the off-site alarm is to be sounded,
and the person who has the responsibility to sound it, should be
clarified, and this should be written in to the emergency on-site
procedures.
Official action taken - legal action: Following the investigation into the incident, ConocoPhillips Limited were charged with a number of offences. They pleaded guilty to the charges under Sections 2 and 3 of the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974, that:a) at the Humber Refinery between 1 January 1996 and 17 April 2001, they did not ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare of their employees; and that b) they also failed to conduct the undertaking in such a way as to ensure, so far as was reasonably practicable, that&amp;nbsp; persons not in their employment who might thereby be affected, were not exposed to risks to their health and safety.The company were fined £400,000 on each charge with costs of £218,854. They were also fined £20,000 for offences concerning pressure systems legislation.Official action taken - other action: HSE served an Improvement Notice on ConocpoPhillips Limited on 1 July 2001 requiring them to draw up an action plan for implementing the provisions of a suitable industry standard for pipework inspections at the refinery and address the corrosion management deficiencies found. This Improvement Notice was complied with.HSE issued a Safety Alert to other UK oil refineries advising them of the need to have effective inspection systems in place around water injection points in process lines, particularly if they are close to bends in the pipework.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Actions taken:a.The company undertook a piping inspection programme 'Hawkeye' at all the higher risk refinery piping systems. This was essentially a Risk Based Inspection review and as a result approximately 3,200 lines were inspected - about 15% of the total refinery system. Another project 'Project 570' was initiated to review the remaining 85% of refinery piping, and 62,000 inspection locations were reviewed, following the guidance in the American Institute Piping Inspection Code API 570, covering the inspection, repair alteration and re-rating of in-service piping systems.b. ConocoPhillips senior management requested a third party audit of all their facilities worldwide, both upstream (exploration and production) and downstream (refining and marketing). This was conducted by specialist consultants with a worldwide reputation in the field of process safety.c. The refinery organisational structure was revised to provide clearer definitions of the responsibilities for mechanical integrity. Inspection and mechanical integrity and their associated actions are key risk control activities, and the monitoring of their performance metrics are reviewed routinely by the refinery leadership team. Conclusions and lessons learned:a. Management of pipework inspectionConocoPhillips failed to implement an effective system for the inspection of pipework on the Saturate Gas Plant (SGP), to complement that in place for process equipment. The system fell far below recognised industry good practice at the time.&amp;nbsp; In addition they failed to use knowledge and experience from other sections of the plant that should have identified the need for more inspection of the SGP pipework. Over time sufficient pipework condition data should have been obtained, and entered onto an inspection database, to verify the believed integrity and inform assessments of future inspection requirements. Without this both the system and the assessments were inadequate.Key lessons:- Effective pipework inspection systems are a vital major accident prevention measure for high hazard pipework.- Such systems should at least meet current industry good practice standard- Decisions on inspection intervals should be informed by suitable and sufficient information on process conditions and previous inspection findings.b. Management of changeThe design and installation of the water injection point in the pipe was not subject to any management of change assessment. Had such an assessment been carried out, the corrosion risk that the injection point introduced for the downstream pipework could have been identified. Similarly no assessment was made of the changes in the use of the water injection point, between continuous and intermittent, over the lifetime of the plant. The frequency of use was a major factor in the rate of the corrosion of the pipework. During periods of continued use more frequent or detailed inspections of the pipework should have taken place to adequately monitor the integrity of the pipe.Key lessons:- Effective management of change systems, which consider both plant and process modifications, are essential to prevent major accidents.- Particular care is needed to ensure that 'quick fix' modifications, during the commissioning and early operation phases of new plant, are covered.c. Management of corrosionConocoPhillips corrosion management on the SGP was not sufficiently thorough or systematic to prevent the failure of the pipe. Some positive actions were taken, including the appointment of a full-time corrosion engineer for the refinery, the introduction of divisional corrosion reviews and monitoring of process streams by sampling, and the installation of corrosion probes, following receipt of specific information in 1992 about the vulnerability of carbon steel pipework in the vicinity of water injection points. Unfortunately these activities were allowed to lapse with the result that there was both insufficient data on, and inadequate resource or focus applied to, corrosion as a potential major accident initiator on the SGP.Key lessons:- Systematic and thorough arrangements are necessary for the effective management of corrosion on major hazard installations.- Such arrangements should ensure that any available information on relevant corrosion degradation mechanisms is identified and acted on.- Adequate resource, including relevant expertise, should be applied to ensure that adequate standards are achieved and maintained.d. CommunicationTwo significant communication failings contributed to this incident. Firstly the various changes to the frequency of use of of the water injection point were not communicated outside plant operations personnel. As a result there was a belief elsewhere that it was in occasional use only and did not constitute a corrosion risk. Secondly, information from the injection point inspection, which was carried out in 1994, was not adequately recorded or communicated, with the result that the recommended further inspections of the pipe were never carried out.These failings were confirmed in a subsequent detailed inspection of specific human factors issues at the refinery. Safety communications were found to be largely 'top-down' instructions related to personal safety issues, rather than seeking to involve the workforce in the active prevention of major accidents. The inspection identified that there was insufficient attention on the refinery to the management of process safety.Key lessons:&amp;nbsp;- Effective communication is an important element of any safety management system. In the context of major hazard establishments the accurate recording and effective sharing of information and data relevant to plant corrosion is essential for major accident prevention.- Communication systems should aim to actively involve the workforce in the prevention of major accidents as part of an adequately resourced process safety management system.Measures to mitigate consequences: Specialist consultants were employed to review the blast damage and explosion over-pressure calculations to improve predictive knowledge. Software used to predict explosion over-pressure was updated and used for all the Humber refinery occupied building risk assessments.Recommendations were made to improve the procedures for calling the emergency services, and for deciding when, and by whom, the the off-site alarm should be sounded.Lessons from the emergency response on-site and off-site were shared with local industries, emergency planning and the emergency services through the local Major Hazards Group. A process was set up to handle concerns among the community and to carry out repairs in a timely fashion. An additional off-site community alarm was installed to cover South Killingholme residents furthest away from the refinery who could not always hear the existing alarm.Useful references: The full HSE report into this incident is available at http://www.hse.gov.uk/comah/conocophillips.pdf</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The protection of the dryers against explosion is assured by permanently maintaining the worm feeders filled,obtained by monitoring the filling level of the bunkers. At minimal level the feeding worm is stopped, maintaining the feeding worm and the silos filled. Blasting waves from or into the dryer are certainly stopped.2. Forming of smouldering nests in the dryer was fostered by an uneven filling with wood-chips of the tandem-dryer. In future the filling of the dryer will be effectively checked by remote monitoring of the regulating system.3. Fire detectors, detecting also ignition sources &amp;lt; 400º C, are under discussion with suppliers.Infrared detectors have,&amp;nbsp; according to expert advice,&amp;nbsp; a limited effectiveness in wood chip dryers.Nevertheless, employing infrared detectors will be attempted.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On site On the first emergency phase corporate officers carried out the shutdown of the pumps, interruption of electricity and the interception of the spill by closing tanks and loading docks manual valves.Subsequently, in response to the presence of large quantities of oil that poured from the square load, directly or through the sewage system in the API separator pool, were activated fire protection systems (water cannons) to keep the product floating (above the ground). Then, according to the reconstruction made by the holders, the staff took steps to stop the flow of water from the wells of the hydraulic barrier (set up for reclamation of the site) to the API separator pool. At the same time the company contracted to perform emergency operations was immediately alerted in order to remove the product from the square load and the APIpool. Later, at about 9:00 am, technicians of the company that operates the sewage treatment plant of the city arrived at the factory to inquire about the registration of the anomalous presence of hydrocarbons at the inlet of its wastewater treatment plant. After having assessed the situation, the staff had taken steps to close (with difficulty) the valve located downstream of the pool API directly leading to the sewer outside the plant and connected to the sewage treatment plant itself. By the information transmitted to the central authorities by the local Fire Brigade, the request for assistance to the firemen at the Oil Depot was received at 10:59 on February 23, 2010 in relation to difficulties encountered in closing the valve from the tank API that connects the sewer to the main collector and from here at the treatment plant of the city.In this regard it should be noted that the emergency procedures of the establishment provide an immediate calling of the fire brigade in case of uncontrollable events within the plant. Off-Site Several containment actions have been put in place along the first river, downstream of treatment plant of city, and along the second river downstream of the confluence with the first river as a result of activation of the emergency occurred at approximately 8:00 am . The treatment plant of the city acted as physical barrier to contain part of the products along the first river. In addition to it the garrison prepared to contain products in corrispondence of an hydroelectric power plant river dam along the second river made it possible to mitigate the effects by limiting quantities of hydrocarbons released in the second river and protecting downstream uses in place of drinking water supply and irrigation, aquaculture and fish farming in the second river delta and the nearby sea. At the treatment plant of the city were recovered (by means auto drain) and disposed about 2,638 tons of oil/water emulsion (data up to March 2, 2010) with an average of 47%of hydrocarbons. At the power plant river dam were recovered most of the quantities of product not retained by the wastewater treatment plant and from the oil barriers played on the first river. The action of containment was achieved by raising the gates of the dam in order to facilitate the flow of water at the bottom and the containment of hydrocarbons on the surface. The product, consisting of a very viscous oil/water emulsion, was recovered using firstly oil skimmers. The process, due to the accumulation of plant debris that did not allow the proper functioning of the equipment, was secondarily guaranteed by means bucket load on a recovery barge. To facilitate the containment and recovery of hydrocarbons at the river dam, actions has been taken to facilitate the accumulation of the floating products on the right side of the river. With regard to actions aimed to wildlife preservation, action was done to removal of the birds in wildlife reserves by means helicopter flybys.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When the column low-level alarm triggered the operator of the subcontractor performed an inspection at the column, and could not detect any faults. Shortly after a high gas-yield was detected in the diisopropanolamine regenerator. Almost at the same time an air-compressor of the Claus-plant and a regenerator failed.The gas flow to the Claus-plants was reduced in order to avoid a complete failure of the plants and the remaining flow was diverted to the H2S flare system. Shortly after release of liquid was detected at the diisopropanolamine -sluice system. The staff was informed that this system had been flushed and sealed and that the regularly scheduled system testing was being performed. For this reason initially the spillage of liquid was not related to the occurrence.&amp;nbsp; Due to the fact that the gas flow at he regenerator still was high, the load at the hydrocracker was reduced immediately by switching over to a a low sulphur crude oil. Further to that the load of the separator before the columns was reduced, in order to reduce the gas flow rate.By 10:28 hrs two gas detectors triggered alarm. Further gas alarms were triggered by 10:30 and 10:32. The shift-leader was informed. The fire department informed the onsite fire-brigade about complaints on odour nuisances in the neighbourhood of the plant. Meanwhile it was understood that the leakage of liquid and gas from the sluice system did not depend from the testing procedures but was related to the incident.The installations were immediately evacuated and inspected by staff members equipped with auto respirators. Following to that the fire brigade was requested to create a foam carpet on the pits of the sluice system in order to avoid further odour nuisances. Parallel to that the off-site fire department communicated that there were complaints about odour nuisances. In accordance with the on-site fire brigade and the fire department an accident notification with possible off-site consequences (D2 notification) was issued, the emergency management team and the emergency response team were alerted. Controls of the on site fire brigade and of the plant staff showed that there was no acute hazard neither on-site nor off-site the installation.The D2 notification was scaled down to D1 (incident without potential off-site consequences)&amp;nbsp; at 13:09. At 13:47 the D1 notification was called back. The extinguishing water was collected in the retention pond for superficial waters and the pumps were shut down in order to allow analysis of the water before pumping it to disposal. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;External services:The fire-brigade performed inspection rounds and measurements.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

After being noticed on 3 February 2017 of the presence of Hydrocarbons in the sewage, the operator undertook the following actions:

-&amp;nbsp;notifications to the authorities required by the IPPC and Seveso (External Emergency Plan) regulations;
- identification of&amp;nbsp;the route of the piping connected to the sewage well outside the establishment, and&amp;nbsp;of the nature and origin of the contaminant;
- interception downstream of the sewage system by inflatable septum;&amp;nbsp;
- excavation of a trench&amp;nbsp;on the internal side of the establishment in order to intercept any contaminated flow;
- installation of&amp;nbsp;piezometers in order to better define the conceptual model and possible contamination and its distribution;
- analysis of sub soil and water taken during investigations;
- under&amp;nbsp;control of the competent authorities,&amp;nbsp; starting of&amp;nbsp;the remediation of the polluted soil, subsoil and groundwater.&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;Subsequently the operator provided for the following corrective actions:

- update of the evaluation of risk associated with the tank oil spill;
- double bottom installation on the crude oil storage tanks;
- implementation of an Extraordinary Maintenance Plan;
- update of the tank storage operational control procedure;
-&amp;nbsp;integrity check of buried pipelines;
- update/issue of concerned&amp;nbsp;HSE IMS procedures taking into account the event occurred:

-periodic inspections on sewage networks
-identification of critical elements/equipment for the environment
-safety procedures operational control
-environmental operational control
-management of accidents, injuries, near miss, medical treatments, first aid cases and unsafe acts/conditions
-management of the&amp;nbsp;operational emergency safety measures.
-operative control procedure for emergency safety barriers and piezometers
-implementation of surface water monitoring procedure for external areas outside the establishment
-implementation of the management scheme for the management of oil spills with external impact



&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The causes of the accident are mainly due to weaknesses in risk assessment in relation to:
• shortcomings in the assessment of risks in terms of consequences;
• deficiencies in the control of the corrosion phenomenon, in the application of the results of the operational experience and in the revaluation of tanks maintenance frequencies;
• shortcomings in the adoption of "compensatory" preventive / protection measures in the waves of completion of the works for the realization of double funds.
In practice, the technical/management safety measures adopted by the operator such as:• Passive tank protection systems (sacrificial anode) combined with day-to-day control of basin integrity and possible loss from tank trunking;• control of water content below the 0.2% threshold;• Moving the bottom of the tanks through agitators to avoid both the separation of water from the oil and the consequent increase in the corrosive processes of the bottom due to the aggressiveness of the water;• the use of corrosion inhibitors;• Immediate action in the emergency responce,were considered sufficient by the operator to ensure the integrity of the tanks during the foreseen maintenance period (10 years) and to estimate that the risk of environmental consequences stemming from these events was still limited and that the potential impact could affect a limited portion of surface, even in the worst conditions.

However, as early as 2013, after 5 years after the first extraordinary maintenance, there was a loss of containment from 2 tanks. This led the operator to adopt as a definitive protective measure the creation of the double bottom of the first&amp;nbsp; tank and the repair of the trunk of the second one.These events should have led the operator to prevent uncontrolled crude oil releases, to re-evaluate the reliability of its tanks and to adjust maintenance frequencies in relation to its operational experience, that is to say, in view of the the predictions of the state of degradation of tank bottoms.
The analysis produced by the operator for the purpose of assessing the consequences of a possible loss of containment and therefore in terms of vertical and horizontal migration speeds of contamination have not been reflected in reality due to the presence of the intubated tract of a buried stream passing accross the plant. Such a channel, the existence of which was not known, constituted a real preferred drainage pathway, with very high hydraulic conductivity in relation to the context, which was necessary for mapping and which would have to be taken into account in calculating the magnitude of the consequences ( horizontal migration speed and extension of contamination).
During the implementation of the mandatory maintenance plan (requested by Authority in 2013) aimed to improve the tank protection equipment (double fund installation), the operator should have promptly implemented&amp;nbsp; at least technical prevention/protection measures of a "compensatory" type, or preventing/monitoring leakage of product from the bottom of the tanks without double bottom and/or mitigate the consequences of such losses (also in the light of the events occurring on other 2 two tank in 2013).

EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Local authority was immediately notified as well as environmental and other authorities. In order to avoid pollution of sea water by fire fighting extinguishing water, since its flow rate was too high and the pump which had to send it to the main waste water treatment plant was not adequate, the overflow was trapped in a pool made out of gypsum and limestone.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the following measures were established:
1- the heating system of the water-bath was replaced by a new one whereby steam is heating water in a closed circuit and hot water is used to heat the water in the water-bath via a heat-exchanger. Both systems are controlled against high temperature by special systems which do not allow the water temperature in the bath to exceed the required temperature;
2- the barrels during  placing in the water-bath have to be protected so that they do not come into contact with heat-exchanger tubes;
3- the water in the water-bath is recycled to obtain homogeneous degree of heating.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, a new system was installed to ensure that, in case of fire, the extinguishing water is collected and safely neutralized.Useful references: According to the dispersion model developped by the Laboratory of Physics of the Environment of the University of Thessalonikiand taking into account the amount involved in the accident and the meteorological data, the combustion products of dimethoate reached a maximum concentration (for SOx) of 1.75 mg/mc at a distance of 100 metres from the installation (the maximum permissible concentration of SOx in the working environment is about 5.32 mg/mc).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The fire grew very quickly. In order to avoid secondary incidents, the Seveso establishment staff, with the help of the fire brigade, removed containers of phosphorus pentasulphide (a flammable product, reacting violently with water, generating hydrogen sulphide and phosphoric acid) to a safe distance. As the situation progressed, large bulk containers stored outdoors started melting and firemen had to deal with the release of liquid fuels. After 2 hours of use, the site’s fire water reservoir (1,860 m³) was empty. It took 5 hours to arrange for water to be pumped directly from the River Seine. The prefect of the department triggered the special intervention plan at around 5.30 a.m. and ordered the confinement of an area within a 500-metre perimeter. The fire, which spread over approximately 3.7 hectares, was brought under control after an intervention of 13 hours. Altogether 276 firemen from several departments, private resources from other companies and 96 m³ of foam were mobilised to fight the fire.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

To put the containers into special construction, which would hold the container inside and would prevent the containers being moved. Measures to mitigate consequences: Technical measures for mitigation of consequences in case of chlorine release: - To install, as a steady water screen, a dry air pipe system out of the store of chlorine with a possibility to connect it to an autonomous pump with a capacity determined by a project. - To limit chlorine storage only to the E 4920 building, that means a reductionto to 50% of original storing capacity. - To further investigate the possible risks in the chlorine storage by a form HAZOP. - To ensure suction of the chlorine deposit by other distribution tubes in sufficient height for a possible level of floodwater, so that it is possible to remove even if the retention tanks are inundated. - To install an autonomous monitoring of accidents with an uninterrupted source of electric energy, with a signalizing siren and a lighthouse to deposit E 4920. - To construct deposit E 4920 as sealed, with seals against extreme pressure and with a possibility to inundate in cases that the whole building could be lifted by floodwater. Organization measures - During any non-operation of the sodium hypochlorite plant for longer than 8 hours, carry out exhaustion of tube distributors into shut-off armature from the containers of chlorine up to the distributors. - Based on the results of a HAZOP study, draw up an appropriate operating regulation and put it into practice.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

After the accident, the firm tightened up its acceptance procedures for waste products. This includes more extensive mixing testing of all waste products that are discharged together into a storage tank.
Following the accident it was decided to stop using the discharge pits. Waste products that are still authorised to be stored in tanks after the stricter tests are discharged directly into tanks. If an explosion occurs in a conventionally designed vertical storage tank, normally only the cover becomes detached due to a weak weld between the wall and the cover. The risk of someone being on the cover at that time is much smaller.
A flame arrester is not a suitable means for preventing re-ignition in the event of continuous or repeated ignition. The flame arrester must therefore be equipped with a temperature detector. If the flame arrester heats up, the pipe can be shut off by a valve to prevent the flame reigniting.
The flame arrester must also be periodically inspected, as contamination can also cause flames to pass through a flame arrester.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

From activation of the alarm, it took 40 minutes before all non-essential personnel was accounted for. This happened because the normal registration system for evacuated personnel was located in a room that was closed due to the ongoing covid-19 situation. Foaming and other activities were continued until the leakage was stopped and the situation was under control.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Plant/Equipment: Corrosion of piping under insulation due to lack of inspection
Organisational/ system related:&amp;nbsp;
- The system did not assertain that that all essential equipment/ piping was included in the inspection and maintenance programme.
- The risk assessment did not evaluate the need for fire- and gas detection in the pipestill area. Had there not been personnel present, the leakage might not be identified in time to prevent an ignition.
Human: The safety of involved operations- and maintenance personnel was nut sufficient during this situation. In the early phase of the situation 3 operators were close to the point of leakage in order to identify the leakage point. They did not carry with them the neccessary HC-gasdetector nor protection against benzen-exposure. This was not according to internal procedures.&amp;nbsp;</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">First aid. The emergency response was notified of the incident at 09:20 but at this time did not receive information that the person(s) had been exposed to nitric acid and NOx. It took about 30 minutes from when they were notified until they were informed that two people had been exposed to nitric acid /NOx. This was probably a contributing factor to the failure to achieve full industrial alarm, but only normal call-outs.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1. As it must be expected that a control loop may fail, and since in this case it could potentially lead to serious consequences, it is recommended to install barrier(s) that reduce the likelihood for such events. Improvement of barriers had not been realised when the incident took place due to prioritisation in the project portfolio.
2. It is recommended to consider whether there is a need to improve heat/cold insulation and possibly install heating cable/steam follower pipes on standpipe for level measurement. It is recommended to make similar assessments in other facilities/equipment if freezing could potentially occur and if this could have serious consequences.
3. Factories should address, on the shifts, the importance of analysing and assessing abnormal sounds, vibrations and movements in process equipment. Possible criteria for stopping a factory/factory section should be discussed locally and if appropriately defined.
4. It is recommended to keep track of people working on electronic work permits on paper. This will provide quick access to data for these individuals, regardless of access to the electronic work permit system.
5. It is recommended that those issuing work permits focus on and facilitate that work permits are parked when they are not being worked on. By parking is meant that a system has been created, which is known, where the performer must report that the work has been paused.
6. In the event of future incidents, efforts must be made to achieve an efficient flow of information that ensures that emergency preparedness is informed as quickly as possible of potentially exposed or injured persons.

In effects, the manual closure of the suction and delivery valves of P-27 pump required about 30 minutes because of the impossibility (due to the presence of flames) to reach the pump. At the same time, the water poured over the plant and, although allowing to obtain the desired cooling, caused the isobutylacetate (and hence the fire) to spread along the waterway for about 50 m.

The biogas zone was sealed off and ventilation was set up near the leak. A sleeve was placed over the leaky section, which was secured until the complete shut off of the digesters it fed into, and its output (18 500 m³ of biogas) was progressively released into the atmosphere through the release valves.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The biogas produced in this plant has a higher H2S concentration than that from other sludge digestion plants, because the sludge contains less ferric chloride (which neutralises H2S). Finally, these biogas pipes are among the oldest on the site, and as a result have suffered longer exposure to the corrosive agents in biogas.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: The company has to review the drying process in order to avoid the recurrence of such an accident. No further investigations.Measures to prevent recurrence: From the analysis of the safety report presented to the competent authorities in compliance to the Italian legislation implementing the Seveso Directive it results that the accident which occurred was considered in the safety report as the most probable with respect to the specific equipment (plant). In relation to this a thorough analysis of possible fire causes had been realised, considering also historical data on fires in similar installations. To avoid the occurence of fires, adequate structural and operational measures had also been foreseen. Nevertheless the accident (fire) occurred, therefore it has to be assumed that it occurred because of the measures foreseen have been implemented not at all or only partially (inadequate implementation, causes identified but no adequate response). It appears that the company had planned to adopt further measures in addition to those indicated in the safety report in order to reduce the fire risk, measures which could not be implemented in time, due to the fire.Useful references: The models employed are those commonly employed for atmospheric releases forming clouds containing combustion products of solid substances (standard models).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">A number of measures to make the process safer have been identified. Measures will also be implemented that do not affect the actual, most likely cause, but also further minimise all other possible and conceivable risks due to technical defects and operator errors. This will further reduce the residual risk.
An analytical control of the approach to oxazolnitril (in-process control) for the water content immediately prior to the addition of phosphorus pentoxide is important here. If water in this process can be sufficiently excluded by analysis, an uncontrolled reaction of water with phosphorus pentoxide cannot occur.The sampling point will be selected in an appropriate manner and the method of analysis will be qualified according to the current standard.
In addition, various additional level measurements will be installed in the installation and piping system to indicate the presence of water from cooling backflows, etc. and to alert staff promptly.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:
When the release occurred, 6 employees were present and each of them
noticed a strong smell of chlorine (there is no evidence that fluoride
gas was present) and left the building as soon as possible. A chlorine
detector, located 3 metres away from the sodium hypochlorite transfer
tank, activated an alarm (it was set to operate at a chlorine
concentration in air of 1 ppm). The security department was immediately
alerted which in turn alerted the medical service and the management. A
4 men rescue team was formed and instructed to enter the pickling
section to check if someone was still there. They were also instructed
to switch-off the equipment. The rescue team found that the sodium
hydroxide transfer tank had overflowed and the liquid had run into the
tank below containing water, nitric acid and hydrogen fluoride. The
pump which was transferring the sodium hypochloryte from the storage
tank to the transfer tank had stopped. No measurements were carried out
immediately after the accident to estimate the chlorine and fluoride
contents in the air. Since chlorine gas is heavier than air, it was
expected that it would take some time for the chlorine vapours to
disperse from the building. ALZ's security service carried out
measurements later with Draeger tubes to detect the presence of
chlorine gas in the building. At about 17:00 hours the production was
started up again since no more than 1ppm concentration of chlorine
could be detected in the production hall by means of Draeger tubes.No off-site emergency measures were required (code 7703). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Emergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: plant emergency shut-down proceduresEmergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: alarms/sirens soundedEmergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: internal emergency teams (fire, ambulance, etc.)Emergency measures taken Onsite: internal systems: gas detection, quantification/dispersion predictionEmergency measures taken Onsite: evacuation: all or mostly by personal transport</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

1) Placed the rescue of victims as the top priority, gave free medical checks to all local residents who felt uncomfortable or ill, and offered free medical treatment to those hospitalized for observation to ensure them not to leave any consequence;
2) Completely closed down Feilong Chemical;
3) Set up an accident investigation group to thoroughly investigate the causes of the accident, and deal with the perpetrator quickly and heavily according to the law;
4) Timely controlled the psychological changes of local residents, especially local students and their parents, and persuaded and appeased local residents to ensure the societal stability;
5) Strengthened the work of the emergency command headquarters and strengthened its subsequent work to prevent the occurrence of other problems;
6) Held a press conference to release information to the media and the public in the timely manner and notified them of the latest situation. At the same time, Gansu provincial government immediately issued an emergency notification to carry out an overall search for production safety hidden risks across the province to firmly avoid the occurrence of similar accidents.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
During the leak, the measuring station could not ascertain quickly enough exactly which operational unit the pipe bridge in question belonged to. This caused a delay in shutting down the pumps and pressure lines, which allowed the release of trichlorosilane to continue.In order to allow for a faster shut down and flushing of bridge pipelines, an emergency plan (with exact location and layout of the pipe’s valves and facilities for flushing it) for each bridge pipeline with critical content will be drawn up by the relevant operators by March 2018 and included in the operating instructions. In addition, the internal instructions for pipeline bridges will be revised by the end of 2017.In order to ensure that the relevant measuring station can be quickly identified in the event of leaks, the specialist unit for pipe bridges is to affix a colour mark every 50&amp;nbsp;m on pipe bridges in the accessible area and label the pipe bridge supports with the pipeline bridge section number by June 2018.Operators are urged to mark the piping with the telephone number of the measuring station. The accuracy and legibility of these markings should be checked during regular inspections.In order to ensure that the pipe bridge data are up-to-date, they are to be imported into the computer system and maintained.


As the event took place in a place particularly affected by corrosion (salt discharge), the plant was examined for further hot spots.In these areas identified as particularly at risk, the firm’s corrosion protection department will carry out comprehensive external checks of the pipes by June 2018. Any deficiencies found will be corrected accordingly.In order to avoid secondary corrosion, old systems that are no longer in use are to be dismantled. If a pipe is to be maintained for subsequent return to service, it is to be treated as an active pipe and must be maintained and marked accordingly.


The quality of corrosion protection will be improved.For example, the removal of rust during maintenance is no longer to be carried out by hand, but by sandblasting. In addition, a partner company is to give confirmation that repairs in critical areas have been carried out properly.The operating engineers have been asked to ensure that works commissioned comply with the plant standards for corrosion protection.In addition, shift staff carrying out inspections are being made aware of the issue of corrosion.

The Government of Upper Bavaria – Labour Inspectorate has also called for a ‘shortening of inspection intervals for pipelines in “hot spot” areas (i.e. areas identified as particularly at risk).’
The lessons learned highlight the importance of operational monitoring procedures (in particular with regard to corrosion, maintenance, alarm management) and emergency planning procedures.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

improved monitoring of the temperature on exit from the spray drying tower, particularly during shut-downs;
replaced the polymer filter vents with metal vents (since they have a more accurate opening range under pressure than polymer vents).

Other improvements are planned for the coming months:

making it possible to inject water into the filter from a remote area so as to reduce the risks in the event of an explosion (reducing human consequences via a more remote intervention area and reducing material consequences via more reactive extinguishing);
studies on:


the possibility of putting in place additional temperature controls (on exit from the cyclones, on exit from the filter) so as to detect problems early;
the feasibility of a smouldering fire detection system so as to detect combustion earlier;
the feasibility of putting place additional automated security systems (emergency shut‑down) if an explosion is detected in the dust filter or if the filter’s vents are open;
technical solutions to reduce the risk of ember transmission between the air-lock/cyclone legs and the air-lock/dust filter;
the possibility of reducing the quantity of product in the air-lock (so as to reduce the likelihood of electrostatic discharge).

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The internal procedures provided the pre-alarm to the external authorities and their 
intervention only in case of alarm confirmation. At 8.45 the pre-alarm concerning the 
first accident was given (external firemen, "Carabinieri", prefecture, mayor, port 
authorities). In the same time the internal emergency plan was put in action with the 
internal fire brigade intervention with foam and water extinguishers of various kinds. 
The emergency procedure required the evacuation from the nearby plants of all the 
persons not involved in the extinction efforts, which resulted in sustaining only 
material damages and no personnel injuries.  After the pre-alarm, the persons assigned 
to the emergency, believing the incident has concluded, gave  at 9:25 an "end of pre-
alarm" signal to the external authorities, which in the meantime have not intervened. 
In the meantime, for prudence, the state of emergency was maintained inside the 
establishment.  At 9:45, having verified the 2nd event, a 2nd pre-alarm to the external 
authorities was issued: in this case the fire-fighting forces of Cagliari intervened; 
however when they have reached the establishment the 2nd incident was also 
concluded.
Official action taken - other official action: An action of the judicial authority (taken by from the jurists police on behalf of the Attorneys Office of the Republic of Italy in Cagliari) is on course in order to collect information.
</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: In both incidents the human error was of great importance. A first consideration is to 
make the procedures of the training more stringent, repeating them at regular intervals, 
as well as the updating of the responsible personnel to the operations in the plant, 
even for operation considered "routine", emphasising the necessity of following to 
the rule, the instructions received and above all the written procedures.
Another consideration consists of the opportunity of making more rigid the security 
processes prescribed for the modification and /or improvement of the plants, in 
particular when external companies are used, when theses operations take place in 
the vicinity of functioning plants, or with operations under work (routine or not), 
adopting a more stringent system for the working permits.
However, because the experience teaches that human errors can happen, although everything is always possible, it would be opportune that some key interventions at the end of the functioning of the security of the plants can not be bypassed, ignored or silenced by the responsible personnel (blockage devices, alarms of extreme intervention, etc.).

Reaching the place the person in charge realised that the noise was caused by compressor K-2901B and tried to stop the compressor via the emergency shut-off switch installed on the control panel near the compressor, then he went to the control room to order the activation of the emergency shut-down procedure, with the activation of the discharge system into the fuel-gas network and the rapid depressurisation by the blow down system.Immediately afterwards the violent release of a hydrogen rich gas mixture occurred from the compressor bottom, the jet ignited almost instantly and hit the adjoining part of the BenSat plant (approximately 14m). The refinery personnel closed the manual valves installed on the pipe mains and started extinguishing operations, activating the fixed cooling systems and the foaming system of the units involved and nearby units.Meanwhile (at 15:03 hrs) the onsite Emergency Control Centre team gathered and established communication with the Advanced Control Centre. At 15:12 hrs the Emergency Control Centre decided to alert the off-site fire brigade. Meanwhile the on-site emergency response team fought the fire from the southeast with a fixed high capacity monitor, from the south with two UNI45 extinguishing hoses, another fixed monitor positioned in the southwest, an extinguishing lorry with a monitor positioned on the northwest, two UNI170 extinguishing hoses in the northeast.At 15:16 hrs the Emergency Control Centre ordered the emergency shut-down procedure to be started for the entire establishment.At 15:30 the first off-site fire brigade team arrived on-site and started to support response operations on the north side, which was more exposed due to the wind blowing from the south and a major presence of fixed extinguishing systems on the south side.The size of the fire was greatly reduced by 15:50 because the compression section of the plant no longer fed the fire; the fire continued in the BenSat unit engulfing it with flames.At 16:25 the fire was practically extinguished, some small flames remained on the highest points; cooling operations continued. At 16:50 the emergency was called off.Meanwhile, at 15:26, the Mayor's office, the Carabinieri and the Prefecture were informed about the occurrence. During the emergency also the 118 - (sanitary emergency call number) intervened at 15:45 hrs. On-site, besides the Fire Brigade Commander of Rome, and the General Fire Brigade Inspector of the Latium Region, also the Prefect and a journalist from the news of the third national Television chain arrived at the refinery (respectively at 16:49 hrs and at 16:52 hrs); representatives from the police headquarters also arrived.Official action taken - legal action: At time of the present report a confrontation was in progress between the company and the supplier of the compressor. An official systematic investigation into the failure cause was expected to be started, subject to appointment of a consultant by the civil court of Rome. 
The company had already requested a technical expert opinion.

The procedures will comprise specific checklists, made available also to the Emergency Control Centre, which will be more efficient in following and supporting operations on the field.- verify the sewage system with respect to the suitability to cope with emergencies- prepare a portable radio communication system, for use only during emergencies, in order to improve communication during emergency response operations.- optimise the availability and location of personal protective equipment- increase the possible intervention points, numerically insufficient- increase the flow rate of the extinguishing water network, verify the performance of the extinguishing water network in terms of flow rate and water storage capacity.With reference to the experience gained and the updating studies carried out the following measures are planned by the company:Structures and equipment:- substitute the reciprocating compressors with a single centrifugal compressor in view of developing the isomerisation unit;-adopt electrically driven shut-off valves at the intake to be mounted near the compressor (the old valves were manually driven), so as to significantly limit any possible gas leakage;- improve the placing of hydrants and fixed monitors. Concerning management and documentation aspects:- improve the localisation of personal protective equipment;- improve the training of the personnel concerning the management of emergencies; systematic call-up of the emergency response team with drills every 15 days;- define for all equipment the sequence of operations needed to secure the equipment;- overhaul the electric securing systems of the machines, defined as a priority with respect to securing the process equipment;- update the risk analysis carried out for the safety report;- start the necessary procedures to tune the on-site emergency plan to the accident scenarios identified in the safety report.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: System of work for clearing blockages unsafe;
the ISO tank should have been vented to relieve pressure before work
commenced. Shift change procedures, particularly communication, need
improvement. On site and off site emergency response were both measured
and effective.Measures to prevent recurrence: As well as addressing the organisational issues noted above, the operator has rebuilt the facility to a much higher standard. Physical controls will be installed to ensure correct sequence of operation and additional containment and mitigation measures will be installed. HSE is undertaking a local project assessing the adequacy of communications at shift handover at a number of COMAH establishments.Measures to mitigate consequences: The off site investigation revealed some confusion in the local community with regard to the type and meaning of alarms and sirens. This operator is located among a number of high hazard plants. All sites have been required to co-operate in developing a coordinated system of alarms and for ensuring effective information is given to the public in the event of an incident. As mentioned above, some residents expressed concerns to their Member of Parliament for the local constituency and these have been discussed with the Competent Authority (HSE), as a result of which a local COMAH liaison committee has been established involving all relevant stakeholders including COMAH establishments, emergency services, local community and Competent Authorities.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

- Containment of contaminated cooling water from 9.21 a.m. on Wednesday 7 March 2012 Clean-up and repair work Environmental damage: measures agreed in consultation with authorities and fisheries experts.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The points listed below represent the recommendations made in accordance with § 19(3), subparagraph 3, StörfallV (Hazardous Incident Regulation). For clarity, the individual measures are briefly outlined as follows. 1. Segregation of the cooling water and rainwater sewer from roof areas which can be polluted by hazardous substances in the event of a malfunction.
The rainwater system of the roof areas of the building affected by the fire no longer drains into the cooling water and rainwater sewer but, by agreement with the water management office, is connected to the plant sewer system.
Similar measures for other areas of the industrial park will require a master plan approved by the authorities. 2. Monitoring of the TOC (total organic carbon) level in the cooling water and rainwater sewers.
For technical reasons the readings from TOC monitoring in the South section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes. This time lag is now offset by having the lower valve located directly ahead of the discharge point into the Alz close at the same time as the upper valve when TOC monitoring gives the signal. Thus, given the flow speed of the water, there is sufficient time to contain any polluted water which has already passed the upper valve by closing the lower valve.
The readings from TOC monitoring in the East section of the cooling water and rainwater sewer are also displayed after a time lag of approx. five minutes for technical reasons. It is currently being examined whether additional TOC monitoring can be installed at a point upstream in the system. 3. All-clear for contaminated sewers given by the plant fire service only after analyses have been carried out.
To prevent any product residues from being washed into the Alz together with cooling water following firefighting operations, where sewers have been loaded with substances toxic to fish or generally hazardous to the environment, in future they will not be given the all-clear until analysis has shown that no products are present. 4. More specific operating instructions and training of staff in the wastewater treatment plant.
The technical and organisational measures taken will be set out in more precisely worded operating instructions for the staff in the wastewater treatment plant. The staff will receive training and instruction twice per year. At the most recent training session it was again pointed out what measures must be taken when certain limit values are reached and in what sequence the valves must be activated in hazardous situations. 5. Shortening the closing time of valves in the cooling water and rainwater sewer.
The stretch of sewer which is closed off by the upper valve has a diameter of 1.2 m.
At normal water levels only approx. 10 to 15 % of that diameter are needed. The basic position of the valve is now set such that only the diameter actually needed is open. This shortens the closing time of the valve. 6. Review of firefighting water retention system.
The plant’s local firefighting water retention system was checked in accordance with the applicable regulations.
The central water retention system is state-of-the-art. It was found to meet the requirements of the applicable regulations in full.
Nevertheless further investigations are currently being carried out to technically optimise the installation, in particular as regards substances which are insoluble and lighter than water. 7. Isolating cooling water from products hazardous to the environment.
In the plant all points at which substances with a fish toxicity of ? 0.1 mg/l are cooled by water are being converted to isolated (primary/secondary circuit) or circulation cooling. 8. Review of all safety equipment in the plant.
All plants in the industrial park will undergo a renewed check and assessment on the basis of the inventory of substances present. The existing safety measures will be reviewed on the basis of the results obtained. If necessary further measures will be laid down. 9. Re-examination of other measuring and monitoring methods.
It is being investigated whether cutting-edge metrology exists with which the sampling of flowing cooling water at varying water levels can be improved even further.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The clarification had to pay particular attention to the operational safety of oxygen valves and pipelines.2) In the second phase (31.1.2005) the establishment had to provide clarification for TUKES on how it has improved the contents and scope of instructions concerning the operation and maintenance of oxygen equipment and how the company will ensure functionality and compliance with the instructions. In this clarification the company had to describe the procedures by which the personnel's knowledge of risk and working methods would be improved. In addition, widespread competence and expertise in the case of oxygen system changes had to be described.3) When the safety report is next updated, the company should identify and present possible accident scenarios pertaining to the oxygen system.

When making alterations or modifications, dependable equipment suppliers must be used. The company should define design and safety requirements for the oxygen systems and in addition, design instructions which should be observed in the design of oxygen systems. &amp;nbsp;3.Clear and extensive written instructions for the use, control and maintenance of the pipelines must be made, and they have to be available to anyone needing them. Any deviations from normal operations should be reported and dealt with in detail.&amp;nbsp; 4.When oxygen lines are put into operation, purity of the pipeline surfaces exposed to the oxygen atmosphere is an absolute prerequisite, which must be adhered to at all phases of construction and installation.

The slide valves are designed to retain extinguishing water and not to retain&amp;nbsp; leaked products in accordance to the requirements of the fire department. In any case the sliding valves could not have retained the leakage of the rinsing liquid containing chrome trioxide into the sewage system, due to the fact that until now failures of the plant could only be detected through the regular inspections rounds, because there was no direct emergency communication system between the plant with the SPS control system of the continuously manned central galvanisation line. When the leakage was detected the chrome trioxide containing rinsing liquid had already leaked into the sewage system.Emergency response measure: Protective measures: - By the personnel:-&amp;nbsp; the safety manger of the company and the fire brigade were alerted following the procedures foreseen by the emergency response plan- interruption of the spillage flow from the building in the courtyard by strewing chemical binders - sealing of the gullies- reduction of the chrome trioxyde with sodium bisulphite;Material damage repaired:- Excavation of contaminated soil in the courtyard&amp;nbsp;- repair of the damaged plantEnvironmental remediation:- Excavation of contaminated soil in the courtyard- Protective measures by external emergency response services:- Information of the sewage treatment plant concerned- Reduction of the chrome trioxyde with sodium bisulphite in the rain water retention pond, used as puffer storage.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Automatic fire alarm operated and the fire brigade intervened. Staff on-site was evacuated.&amp;nbsp; A total of 19 pumps, 2 turntable ladders, 1 hydraulic platform, a foam tender, a breathing apparatus tender and control unit were involved, and up to 22 BA sets were in use at any one time, with over 140 individual wearings of sets. Firewater runoff retained almost entirely in on-site effluent treatment plant. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Progressive implementation of pre-existing local emergency plan with precautionary evacuation of 3,000 local residents who might have been at risk from toxic components of smoke plume. The site was not subjected to the more stringent requirements arising under article 5 of Directive EEC/501/82 but the storage of petroleum spirit under license would be known to the emergency services and routine familiarization visits and logs of data held by them would in the circumstances provide a ready guide to the task that faced them. In that way, the generic "all-hazard" emergency off-site plans at County and District Government levels were brought into play and the smoothness of the precautionary evacuation bears tribute to the systems of emergency planning that was in place.No emergency measures are stille required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Bulk chemical storage at the site has been discontinued. A series of notices under the 
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 have been served to ensure that the company reviews its procedures for storage and disposal of chemicals, and that revised procedures and standards are adopted and followed if the store is rebuilt on this or other sites.Measures to mitigate consequences: Off-site clear-up was initiated and completed within a few weeks by staff of firm and specialist fire-fighting/clear-up team from firm's parent company. Off-site property damages have been repaired.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string"> In order to prevent similar accidents, the investigation team recommends
the following measures. The recommendations are general,
concerning the entire industry.  Equipment
that have been added to ensure the safety of the process must be placed so that
their visual inspection and maintenance can be performed safely. Safety equipment
and devices should preferably have appropriate indicators or be connected to
the automation system so that their actuation can be detected.The
reasons for the actuation of the safety devices/equipment must be identified.
Running the production against the safety controls must not be accepted as a
normal procedure. The risks
related to the aging of equipment must be assessed. Special attention must be paid
to process safety critical devices and their preventive maintenance, condition
inspections and need for renewal.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The operator
must ensure that the workers are aware of the hazards of different tasks and
work areas as well as the related safety and work instructions. The
instructions must include procedures on how to bring the process back into a
safe state after a fault situation. Management must go through the essential
safety instructions with the workers and supervise that instructions are
followed. Adequate
communication between shifts must be ensured. Appropriate shift change and
communication methods must be defined for operator-based maintenance workers.Operator-based
maintenance workers must receive sufficient guidance concerning the work area
and the tasks, including related hazards, before starting the work. Liabilities
and obligations concerning activities performed after fault situations
(including shutdowns and startups) must be clearly defined. Management of change must also include
the assessment of the safety effects of smaller changes. The up-to-dateness of
risk analyses, instructions and P&amp;amp;ID must be checked regularly. The maintenance responsibilities for
installations that are situated across several departments and units must be
clearly defined.Also when handling and storing chemicals that
are formed during the production process, regulations and guidance concerning
the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals must be followed.  Internal
audits and inspections must also take into account the failure mechanisms of process
safety critical systems as well as procedures for corrective actions concerning
fault situations, including the responsibilities and tasks of the operating and
maintenance staff.New in Tukes: A short video "What was learnt" in Finnish. We have prepared also a slide show and a bulletin.

The mixture then ignited probably because of electric discharges caused by movement of the drainage hose (which was probably not made of antistatic material), or because of sparks from non-ATEX equipment found near the manhole, or because of improper mobile phone use in the basin area.
The causes mentioned can be put down to management shortcomings essentially linked to: inadequate training of internal and external staff, unsuitable operating procedures and inadequate risk analysis of the work to empty the tanks containing flammable liquids.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The Internal Contingency Plan was activated and a crisis team was set-up in the Prefecture. Significant resources were allocated to both land and aerial surveying.Shortly thereafter, a ship equipped for hydrocarbon recovery was deployed at the river mouth as well as two trawlers in the estuary equipped with special nets for collecting hydrocarbon pellets. Floating barriers were also deployed in order to recover floating hydrocarbons.The affected fuel line was shut down; inspections on the entire rack detected several on other lines corrosion points requiring repair.Following both the first inspections performed after the accident and the first conclusions of the refinery’s internal accident investigation, several protective measures were implemented, namely:- permanent human surveillance along the pipe network bordering the Loire;- definitive shutdown of the defective fuel oil pipeline;- visual inspections and thickness controls critical points (braces, tapping points, etc.) after removal of the thermal insulation from the entire pipe rack bordering the Loire;- relocation of the service water pipe from the thermally insulated pipe-rack bordering the Loire.Moreover, a prefectural order prescribed the implementation of several technical and organisational improvement measures:_ Onsite :- Integration of liquid hydrocarbon and chemical product lines in the inspection schedule, considering their criticality with respect to environmental risks;- setting up of regulations for degraded thermal insulation detection and repair campaigns of;- setting up of regulations and procedures for repairing leaks on utility lines (particularly water and steam networks);- specification of requirements and allocation of remote detection equipment adapted to the various products and sensitive zones._ Specific to the pipe rack where the accident originated: - works on the ground underneath the pipe-rack, such to allow drainage of spills towards a gutter connected to the refinery’s oily water network, thus preventing leaks from polluting the Loire;- installation of a permanent monitoring and leak detection system on pipe-lines located in the vicinity of the Loire by means of thermal cameras coupled connected to an image management and abnormality reporting system in the control room, completed by a leak detection device in the gutter, in case of leaks occurring beyond the field of vision of the thermal camera system;- monitoring of product transfer operations by all means such to control that quantities transferred from the storage facility are actually received at the other end of the pipeline.An information and communication system for the various parties involved was introduced.This system comprises:- a daily press debriefing from the crisis team coordinated by the Prefect,- creation of a team assigned to distribute compensation to pollution victims,- organisation of regular meetings with local elected officials and associations,- constitution of a local information commission on river estuary pollution risks.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">1/ Prevention measures: - The importance of monitoring corrosion or, put more
broadly, "precursors" of installation ageing in older plants and
sites (which extends beyond the case of pipe networks). Special attention must
be paid to:  _ "corrosion sensitive points" (corrosion
beneath thermal insulation, contact with supporting braces, etc.); _ installations positioned in the vicinity of sensitive
and vulnerable zones or located in an "aggressive" environment (tidal
effects, medium salinity, etc.). - Special attention must also be paid to monitoring
and maintaining pipe networks in the plant by means of establishing pertinent
criticality parameters (e.g. analysis of environmental risks related to a loss
of structural integrity, sampling and control modes that enable early detection
of corrosion or defects, periodicity of controls adapted to degradation
kinetics, acceptability criteria specific to a defect). Following this accident and based on results of
inspections carried out on the Donges site pipes, a nationwide action was
launched during 2008 focusing on probe controls of pipes carrying hydrocarbons.
In 2009, a widespread plan centred on the ageing of industrial installations
(petroleum, chemical) was initiated by France s Sustainable Development
Ministry, which by the end of 2009 will yield a national action plan. 2/ Detection and protection measures: The efficient control of certain specific operations
(ship loading, pollutant transfer, etc.), especially on expansive sites,
integrates appropriate resources to be allocated to leak detection and
protection as well as vulnerability of the specific media. 3/ Means of intervention: For those media in need, an action plan is developed
that prescribes tools dedicated to impact evaluation, intervention and
pollution cleanup, for mandatory implementation in case of an accident; the
conditions governing the availability ofsuch tools are also to be included.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

At about 9.30 on 26 September 2014, during a patrol they were making owing to the presence of odours, the operations staff detected the presence of virgin naphtha in a limited area of the tank roof. Checks were made immediately and showed that the product was escaping because the western side of the roof was starting to sink as it was taking in liquid from the pontoon sections on the same side.The filling of the tank was interrupted at about 9.40 on 26 September 2014.At about 10.30 on 26 September 2014, the refinery’s management decided to empty the tank as per the operating manual, in addition to implementing all the necessary preventive measures to ensure safety, namely: continuous attendance of firefighting vehicles; preventive covering of the product on the roof with a foam extinguisher; presence, in continuous shifts, of firefighting and technical operations teams for the emptying operation.The layer of extinguisher was applied to the product on the roof at about 10.45 on 26 September 2014.The operations staff started emptying TK&amp;nbsp;513 at about 12.20 on 26 September 2014.In the hours that followed, the transfer of the product continued, whilst the layer of extinguishing foam was maintained by means of successive top-ups that were needed both to cover the product on the roof and owing to increased wind intensity.At about 0.45 on 27 September 2014, the fuel was found to have started leaking and then the fire to have broken out on the tank roof. The level of the tank was estimated to be about 5.5&amp;nbsp;m (it had not been possible to gauge the level for several hours), corresponding to a volume of virgin naphtha of about 30&amp;nbsp;000 m3. The internal emergency plan was put into action. The municipal and provincial fire brigades were notified.The tank’s fire protection (cooling and foam spraying) systems were activated immediately. The cooling systems of three adjacent tanks were turned on. The cooling systems of two tanks located further to the south, beyond the embankment of a former railway, were later also turned on. It was possible to keep tank shell temperatures under control with the aid of a thermal sensor. Firefighting equipment and perimeter hydrants were used to protect the lines of transfer of the product in TK&amp;nbsp;513 from irradiance (north side), as was the rack to the south of the tank so as to prevent fire spreading to the vegetation on the trackbed of the former railway.The fire brigade arrived on the scene. At about 2.00 on 27 September 2014, transfer of the product in TK513, interrupted when the emergency arose, was resumed in order to minimise the quantity of product burned.At about 10.00 on 27 September 2014, the most intense phase of the fire seemed to have ended; there were far fewer flames but there was still some smoke activity. The tank's firefighting systems were found to be still active. The on-site and external firefighting teams remained in attendance and monitored the situation.The end of the emergency was declared at about 17.30 on 27 September 2014.On 28 September 2014, the situation was stable, with just one spot fire in the south side of the tank. In the meantime, the cooling of the tank shell, using the cooling ring and monitors, and the removal of the product both continued, although the pump was activated discontinuously by the operator.Traces of smoke could still be detected in the air.From 04.00 to 09.00 on 29 September 2014 there was a resurgence of smoke due to a number of residual spot fires.There was another resurgence of smoke at approx. 9.00-14.00 on 30 September 2014, again due to a number of residual spot fires.&amp;nbsp;In response to this, action is being taken, together with the provincial fire brigade HQ, to put in place fixed foam spraying systems with mounted monitors (including two high-power (7&amp;nbsp;000 and 10&amp;nbsp;000 lt/min) systems) in order to extinguish residual spot fires more quickly.It was then decided to revert to cooling the shell and draining the tank.At about 23.00 on 3 October, all the spot fires had been extinguished.The company stated that the internal emergency plan (IEP) had been put into action immediately and had dealt with the emergency. As decided by the Prefecture, the external emergency plan (EEP) was not put into action.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Risk analysisFollowing the accidental event of November 2002 a thorough safety assessment of the plant starting from the cause analysis has been further developed using different up to date methodologies.The studies and analysis listed below, applied to the high-boiling tars section and to the entire TDI production process, followed by the implementation of technical and procedural changes, demonstrate the high safety standard reached and maintained and in particular with regards to process control, management of failures and accident prevention.The characteristics of the high-boiling tars processing section of department TD5, and particularly concerning the chemical behaviour of the products processed, correlated with the parameter of residence time, temperature and composition, lead to the accident dynamics of November 2002 being considered anomalous, due to the fact that it could not have happened in any other section of the department or in any other phase of the processing cycle. LPP (Loss Prevention Programme) Guidelines for the analysis of the compliance of the process with the accident prevention principles.This methodology was developed by the technological centre of the company based on the experience gained in the establishments of Dow and other major companies operating worldwide.The compliance with these guidelines allows the performance in terms of safety and operating reliability in general to be improved.These guidelines often reflect the entire experience and knowledge gained on the management of process plants and the process anomalies that may occur in any of the activities involved in the management of a chemical plant (design, process control, operation, safety procedures, equipment).Analysis of the management systems of the combustion plants.As for the foregoing guidelines this tool is used inside the company to compare the combustion systems (heating furnaces, steam generators) with the most advanced technologies in the field of safety and reliability.During the audit the problems concerning the management of the furnaces, the safety systems (alarms, shut-down systems), the control systems and the process parameters were analysed, using the most advanced international standards as reference and complying with Italian and European norms.- Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)The LOPA analysis is a simplified form of risk analysis that analyses the risk of an undesired event over the magnitude of the event frequencies, effect gravity and event probability.The LOPA process builds a risk analysis process using all data available from the Dow technological centre, from the databases of the company, from the plant histories and using the specific knowledge of the process engineers of the plants (from Dow or other companies).The analysis demonstrates that the implemented safety systems are adequate to obtain acceptable risk levels.- Investigation into the problems concerning chemical reactivityAll aspects concerning chemical reactivity of the substances present in the TDI production cycle were examined very closely; product incompatibilities and eventual instabilities were analysed.Chemical reactivity matrices and reference guidelines, based on Dow's experience, have been issued for the personnel of all Dow installations and in particular for those producing isocyanates.A detailed analysis was&amp;nbsp; performed on the reactivity of TDI and high-boiling tar mixtures with respect to different parameters, such as temperature, residence time and composition, referring also to the accident that occurred in November 2002.Paragraph 2.4 lists the studies carried out, these studies have been used to increase the safety of various sections.-Definition of Process Safety Cardinal RulesDevelopment and implementation of the cardinal rules concerning the process safety during production of dinitrotoluene, toluene di-amine, toluene di-isocyanate and phosgene.These rules have been developed based on the experience of Dow and other leading companies gained in plant management; the rules indicate in a clear and concise way the criticality of different process phases, pointing out the operations to be avoided, with the goal of operating at the highest safety levels.- Pre start-up Audit As foreseen by the procedures of the company an audit was performed on the plant to check if there were the necessary safety conditions to restart the plant following the recent shut-down for maintenance.The audit was carried out on the entire plant with particular attention on the high-boiling tars processing section upstream the introduction of chemical reagents in the process; the&amp;nbsp; performance of all foreseen test procedures on equipment and piping subject to maintenance was audited, and adequate training of the operative plant personnel was verified with specific checklists.The implementation of the procedures contained in the operative manual was verified with a particular focus on the safety standards.- Updating of the operative manualThe entire operative manual of the department was revised, not only with regards to the high-boiling tars treatment section, which was the main reason of the revision, but also for all departments of the plant.- Management of change (MoC)All technical or procedural changes have to be assessed through a MoC procedure analysing the consequences of the change with specific checklists with the participation of all roles involved.When the present report was issued, it was foreseen that by the time&amp;nbsp; modifications were operative&amp;nbsp; the operating procedures for the modified plant would also be available and the training of the personnel would have been concluded</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The decant tower in the return-water pond was opened and measures were taken to prevent erosion damage at the emergency outlets.Emergency measures - Remarks: Personnel from Norrbotten county admistrative board visited the Aitik mine immediatly after the dam failure.Official action taken - legal action: Norrbotten county administrative board has adjudged that Boliden violated their current permit according to the Environmental Code and the Water Law, which is why the company has been reported to the court on the following four points: (1) Overfilling the clarification pond. (2) Not following conditions stated in the given permits in the Water Law. (3) The characteristics of the dam had been changed without seeking permission for alterations. (4) For having unsanctioned steep embankment sides.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Boliden's manual for operation, supervision and maintenance of dams contains an emergency response plan. It has been verified that the routines in this plan worked well as regards both contacts and measures. One deficiency was noted, the possibility to set off the alarm for high water level in the clarification pond without any immediate follow up investigation. Therefore the routines have been changed so that alarms for both low and high water levels cannot be set off in the control room at the dressing plant, but have to be set off at the recirculation water gate.Useful references: Dam failure at the Aitik mine: Investigations, conclusions and measures taken.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The cleaning interval for the machine outlet system will be shortened. Up to now, the system has been cleaned annually.
The machine outlet plan will be optimised.

Recommendations from the authority:

Ensure that combustible residues in the exhaust systems are regularly removed by cleaning or are prevented by technical means from entering.
Examine technical options for optimising emulsion input, and implement as appropriate.
Create and label openings for the injection of extinguishing agents into the exhaust systems.
Review and, if necessary, update firefighting plans in accordance with DIN (German Institute for Standardisation) requirements.
Keep multiple copies of the firefighting plans on site.
Carry out regular exercises with external emergency services (in particular with the on-site fire brigade and the municipal fire brigade) to familiarise them with the location.
Ensure that sufficient master keys are available at all times for external fire brigades.
Install an early fire detection system and an extinguishing system in the exhaust systems.
Draw up an information sheet on the possible adverse effects/consequences of shutting down the energy supply to parts of the plant affected by an accident. This should be made accessible to external emergency services/fire brigades, as well as being kept on site.

An extensive sprinkler system will be installed in the manufacturing areas.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Over time the operation of the steam reboil system had changed from automated to manual control, due to instability while on automatic. This was not a planned change, assessed through the formal Change Management process, but more an operational response to a daily operating difficulty. The consequence of this change, particularly during upset conditions, was therefore not adequately assessed.Further prevention actions:All equipment that may have been subjected to over-pressure was thoroughly inspected. PSV use was reviewed to determine the failure mechanism. The PSV inspection interval was reduced to a 12 month interval. An investigation of the reasons for the steam control to be routinely run on manual was conducted. This concluded that routine operation on automatic was unlikely to be successful. A high-pressure trip function based on column pressure was installed to cut-off the steam supply.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Hypothesis 2: Fire caused by electrical appliances was classified as possible.As a measure, old lighting systems (mercury vapour/fluorescent lights) were replaced.In the case of strip lights (fluorescent lights), as a precautionary measure, an EX light that can be ruled out as an ignition source was selected as standard.Spotlights were replaced with LED spotlights.In 2017, approximately 1,500 lights were replaced at a total cost of around €900,000.&amp;nbsp;
Hypothesis 3: It is possible that the fire was caused by negligent arson.&amp;nbsp;
Hypothesis 4: It is possible that the fire was caused by intentional arson.Investigations were stopped/no further action by the Public Prosecutor’s Office as there was no evidence to suggest this.Independently of the preventive measures, the expansion of the on-site fire brigade (in terms of human and technical resources) has continued.Key points:

Introduction of a shift system providing a service operated by full-time staff for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.
Step-by-step construction of 1:5 staffing with full-time firefighters on the 24-hour service by the end of 2019.
Increased training of full-time staff to a B1 qualification. There are currently 12 employees in training.
Renewal of the fire detection system by the introduction of a PSIM (Physical Security Information Management) system and extension of the fire detection system.
Improvement of equipment by the purchase of fire engine with an articulated arm with a working height of 42&amp;nbsp;m.

These measures were initiated independently of the fire event.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The emergency services react quickly. A large plume of black smoke develops and partially touches the nearby urbanised zone. Since the meteorological situation was not favourable for the rising and the dispersion of the plume, the emergency services ask the population to remain inside the buildings. The event is abundantly covered by the media because of the broadcasting of the directions for confinement by the local radios. Three schools located in the direction of the plume are evacuated. The fire is under control after 2h 30 min. The confinement measures are suspended around 13:30, since the fire has been extinguished. The emergency services keep monitoring the situation during the whole of the following day.After the fire was extinguished, a number of measures were taken to ensure a follow-up:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Protective Measures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Inspection of all installations and&amp;nbsp; assessment of the operational conditions of the site (administrative and regulatory situation),&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Prefect's decree prohibiting the resumption of activities and prescribing clean-up - waste storage -&amp;nbsp; and waste removal - measures to be carried out,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Health-related measures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Consultation of 360 doctors on the health-related consequences of exposure to the smoke,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * Environmental measures:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - A monitoring campaign of the ground and of vegetation in the area affected by the accident,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Monitoring analysis of the extinguishing water originating from the fire fighting, of the sewage water and of the water in the sewage treatment plant.The following results were obtained:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * With respect to health and the environment, the impact was minor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * At the time of the accident, the company was operating the plant in a way that anticipated the authorisations that had been applied for. (specifically, increase of the quantities of stored MDI)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; * The inspection of the installations has highlighted the absence of a system for the retention of extinguishing water, as well as an inadequate delivery rate of fire-fighting water, the fact that waste was stored without any containment system and exposed to the atmosphere, and the fact that an incomplete file had been submitted when applying for authorisation.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">With regard to technical aspects:The fire-walls and the emergency services response operation allowed the accident to be kept adequately under control, but the fire-wall's efficacy was compromised by the presence of the sky-dome too close to it. It is important to consider the risk of ignition of elements that can melt when heated and which can compromise the efficacy of protection devices such as fire-walls.AdministrationThe applications for authorisation of installations already in use must be the object of formal notices, according to Article L514-2 of the environmental Law.In hazard studies, it is imperative to describe the substances that may be formed by decomposition during a fire, and to evaluate the consequences, in order to adjust the prevention, protection and response measures.Crisis management:The event had an extensive media coverage through the broadcasting by the local radios of the confinement instructions,&amp;nbsp; information which was picked up by the national radios. A large number of press organisations immediately sent reporting teams to the site; they arrived before any overview of the situation could be obtained and even before any real operational command post could be set up. This almost instantaneous media coverage of the event created a strong pressure of information demand on all those involved in the response operations, even before the establishment of structures for co-ordination and for the collection of reliable information on the event and its consequences.As an accident occurs, the emergency services must prioritise the following two main aspects of crisis management:*&amp;nbsp; The mobilisation and the up-grading of the system for immediate emergency response*&amp;nbsp; The activation of the co-ordination and command structure, in order to facilitate:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - The drawing up of a preliminary overview of the situation and the correct assessment of the event;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - The activation of a structured system for gathering and recovering verified information;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Control of the spreading of the warning after the event.The last point can be achieved only by the activation of an operational command post on the site and of a crisis management team in an operational command room of the prefecture. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Given the succession of accidents arising over the previous few months in the chemical and petroleum industries, combined with the pipeline transport of hazardous substances, a meeting was organised in September 2009 to discuss industrial safety challenges and environmental protection between the Secretary of State for Ecology and industry leaders in these sectors. The industry delegation submitted proposals for improving the safety of their facilities, led by enhanced ageing controls on installations and their maintenance, while committing to greater focus on sensitive ecological zones in order to improve species protection and preservation zones.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

One of the employees was soon found unconscious inside the hall close to the gas scrubber. Rescue services were called after the unconscious employee had been carried out of the facility. They delivered the exposed employees to emergency care and isolated the dangerous area. People living in the area were warned during the accident using an emergency population warning and vehicle speakers of the rescue department and the police.
Filling the vessel with water was selected as the protective measure, but a suitable coupling to connect the rescue vehicle to the plant’s pipeline was only found after some searching. Approximately 25 m3 of water was pumped into the tank. During the rescue operation, the generation of gas decreased and eventually stopped entirely.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

Waste handling companies must identify the hazardous properties and reactivity of waste chemicals in as much detail as possible based on the CLP regulation’s classification criteria. Classifications and labelling related to the transport of dangerous goods may not necessarily provide sufficient information about the hazardous properties of chemicals to the extent required by the chemical safety licence.
Producers and handlers of waste chemicals must ensure, through the exchange of information, that the hazardous properties and classifications are understood similarly in all parts of the waste chain.
Waste producers must ensure that handlers and recipients of waste are authorised to handle the waste chemicals in question, considering the environmental and safety permits issued (by the Regional State Administrative Agencies and Tukes). The hazardous properties and classifications of waste must be compared to the waste items permitted for handling and storage in the production plant’s licences and to the classifications of hazardous chemicals.
Operators that handle and store hazardous chemicals must address the volumes of chemicals generated by identified dangerous reactions or other incidents when defining the scope of operations in permit applications (ratio calculation).
Tukes (CA) must ensure that the volumes of chemicals generated as a result of any loss of process control and the impact of any accident have been assessed and presented in the permit applications of production plants. Hazardous chemicals generated during incidents may be significant in battery warehouses and other locations where electric batteries are kept, where any fire may generate significant volumes of toxic gases.

The defective pipe was replaced and inspected after three, six, nine and twelve months, with no abnormalities being detected.  Inspections must currently be carried out every twelve months on the section of pipe concerned. The inspection results show that the material used in the past is suitable for use in the high-pressure section of urea plants. Nevertheless, the use of higher-quality, i.e. more corrosion-resistant, material is planned when critical pipes are replaced.  Furthermore, an additional risk-based inspection programme (RBI) is used to more effectively monitor parts of the process plants that are critical to the system.

The operational staff who went to the location found white smoke leaking from the hydrogen supply line followed by the outbreak of a fire with a light-coloured, horizontal flame. The alarm was raised and the order given for the unit to be rapidly depressurised and cut off. The firefighting team attended an air cooler where a fire was clearly breaking out and in the vicinity of the reactor using the necessary firefighting vehicles and equipment to contain the incipient fire and cool the surrounding metal structures. The fire brigade was called at 4:05 p.m. once it had become clear how serious the situation was. When the firefighters arrived, they continued the containment and cooling activities with the help of refinery personnel. Operations continued through the night until 7:50 a.m. on 2 December, with cooling and control activities going on until the afternoon of 2 December. As per the IEP, the local authorities were kept constantly abreast of how the accident was developing, both by the company and by fire brigade representatives present on site. Based on how the situation developed, the local authorities did not deem it necessary to trigger the External Emergency Plan (EEP).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

temporary pieces had to comply. The T-piece used screw thread which made it
possible to turn the T-piece. The accident showed that a standard for temporary
pieces must be drawn up. In the company it was seen as normal that the manual
valves in the line on which the T-piece was fitted had a small internal leak.
So in the work permit protective clothing should have been specified for
working on this line since they should have anticipated that HF would build up
between the fixed (leaking) valves and the quarter turn valve on the temporary
T-piece. A Quarter turn valve is easily manipulated accidently, certainly while

In fact, sodium chlorite is stored at the plant and on sold on to customers in the same containers in which it arrives at the plant, i.e. without any pouring.The container used in error was present on the vehicle used the previous day by the same worker and not unloaded, together with a second container that had previously been used for hydrochloric acid and which should have used for filling.There is thus also a problem in how the yard is organised as regards the management of containers that can be used for pouring operations (in particular as regards those not to be re-used and to be returned to suppliers empty) and, above all, with regard to the incompatibility of substances.As regards the incompatibility between the substances sold and present in the plant (as indicated in the internal procedure), consideration should also be given to the need to check the containers to be used for pouring operations, e.g. to check:&amp;nbsp;

the label identifying the substance previously present;
whether any residues are present;
the actual nature of the residues;
whether the container to be used needs to be cleaned.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The on-site emergency plan was activated. There were never less than 8 appliances on-site. Initially, a water mist curtain was put up to limit the diffusion of hydrogen chloride gas. After the fire started, foam was applied to the two process vessels to prevent their rupture. The southern half of the site had to be shut-down (except the sodium plant and the boiler house) and was evacuated for the duration of the fire and more extensive evacuation was considered but this was not necessary.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan was activated. A nearby road was closed and two neighbouring premises were alerted in case evacuation became necessary.Emergency measures - Remarks: 2022 - flammable gas alarm sounded. 2026 - following investigation works emergency signalled. 2031 - work fire tender on scene. 2036 - major emergency declared and off-site help requested. Attempts by 2 employees to identify leak and enter gas cloud. 2047 - fire appliances arrived and set up a water curtain. 1 employee and 2 pairs of fire fighters on different occasions entered gas cloud at request of plant supervisor to close valves. 2125 - ignition. 2300 - major foam attack. - 2323 - possibility of complete evacuation of EC plant and alert to local authorities. 2350 - fire reduced to 2 main areas. 0100 - fire contained and under control. 0834 - fire extinguished. 1220 - small quantities of release finally stopped. 22 local authority fire appliances were used. The final 10 used to help transfer increased foam stocks required during major fire attack.Official action taken - legal action: Prosecution in Crown Court on 2.2.96 under section 2 and 3 Health &amp;amp; Safety at Work Act 1974 for endangering employees and others (principally fire fighters). Company fined a total of 150000 pounds with full costs of 142655 pounds awarded to HSE. The payment of full costs is now subject to an appeal by the company.Official action taken - other official action: 3.2.94 Prohibition Notice (PN) issued prohibiting company from restarting production of ethyl chloride (EC) until it had demonstrated that "the major accident hazards had been identified and that appropriate precautions had been taken to limit the consequences to persons and the environment". 
4.2.94 Notice issued to leave plant undisturbed during investigation. Written notifications required to safety report because of change of working whilst EC plant closed, e.g. chlorine from electrolytic cells held in rail tankers. EC shipped in by boat and rail. 
Written modifications to safety report required for new EC plant because of design changes. These were thoroughly assessed. Also changes to maintenance management procedures were required before the PN was considered complied with.
The PN was confirmed as complied with in December 1994 and the plant restarted in January 1995.Discussion about response: A published report will be available from 10 July 1996. A copy will be sent at that time if requested.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

After the beginning of the fire the operator at he control panel shut down the furnaces and separated (isolated) the loading (charging) FICVs (2002 A/B and 2002 A/B) of those two furnaces. The control panel operator moved to the Battery Limits of units 2000 and 2100, where he succeeded in shutting (cutting, closing)&amp;nbsp; the crude oil charging valve&amp;nbsp; of the unit. Afterwards he closed (shut, cut) in the Battery Limits the valves of Unit 6100 and of the the slops.An operator of Unit 2000 moved to to the Battery Limits with the goal to close the gas valve and all other valves, in order to isolate the unit.A fix monitor (mounted extinguisher) placed in the room was put into service in order to protect the accumulator D 2004.Approx. 3 or 4 minutes after the fire started, the shift electrician closed down the electric supply in the corresponding substation.Meanwhile all other units of the lubricating oil plant were shut down.When the Communication Control Room received information on "emergency in Unit 2000" , the general alarm and the onsite emergency plan were activated.When the emergency response vehicles reached the place, immediately the emergency response co-ordinator (shift leader of the security service) started with the strategic disposition of human and material emergency response resources, integrating in the emergency response team also all the personnel of the unit&amp;nbsp; not needed for emergency process control measures.The collaboration of the voluntary fire-brigade of Matosinhos-Leça was also requested through the direct telephone line, which has been set up between the Communication Control Room and their headquarters. The intervention of the voluntary fire-brigade, which responded to the request for support, was coordinated by the emergency response coordinator and can be summarised essentially in measures for cooling the equipment located in the area involved by the fire with the goal to avoid possible ruptures (failures) due to heat radiation of ( the heat emitted by) the fire.During the extinguishing operations fire hoses, fix monitors (mounted extinguishers), water curtains with sprinklers, and fire-fighting vehicles were used, employing as extinguishing agents foam and powder&amp;nbsp; and water as cooling agent in order to avoid the risk of re-ignition, after having extinguished the fire.Apart from measures directly linked to the extinguishing operations some water curtains were set-up (created, put into place) in order to avoid as far as possible the diffusion (expansion) of the fire.The fire was considered as extinguished at 05:00:00. The cooling operations of the equipment were maintained until the emergency response coordinator ordered to send the signal of the end of the emergency , after having inspected the entire area of the accident.All products, in liquid phase, deriving from the fire fighting measures, were collected by the drainage system for oily waters, and were conducted through it towards the waste water treatment plant of the refinery.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The production units were shut down, water curtains were set up around the storage tank. The external fire brigades arrived around 18:50. Road traffic was stopped South of the site at 19:10 and South East of the site at 19:35. The TGV high speed train line was closed at 20:00.Random explosivity measurements were carried out around the establishment from 19:10 on&amp;nbsp; by the operator, and from 20:00, in a more organised way, by the external fire brigades and by the on site fire brigades.All emergency response measures ended around 22:30.On request by the Classified Installations Inspectorate, a study on the atmospheric dispersion of the butadiene cloud was carried out, in order to determine whether the cloud which dispersed towards the South / South-East could have generated an explosion off-site, and to evaluate whether the population exposed to the cloud's passage may have suffered irreversible health effects.This study highlighted the fact that the explosiveness areas did not cross the property limits. As to the irreversible health effects (IDHL) zone, it seems that it extends a little outside the property limits, however it does not reach any residential buildings outside the site.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In addition to the accident analysis, the Regional Directorate For Industry, Research and Environment (DRIRE -- Direction REgionale de l'Industrie, de la Recherche et de l'Environnement) which is responsible for the inspection of classified installations, has requested the company to present a plan for the prevention of similar accidents.The following measures have been taken:* Inventory of similar configurations for the complete U400 production unit, according to the following criteria:- Presence of dry or wet butadiene without inhibitor- Development of pop favoured by temperature- Development of pop favoured by the presence of a gas phase- Development of pop favoured if the output is low or nil (dead end section, upper taps of tanks in the gas phase, valves and fittings, etc.)- Cast iron valves and fittings* Analysis of the risks of the installations based on the following criteria:- Presence of dry or wet butadiene without inhibitor;- Development of pop favoured by temperature;- Development of pop favoured by the presence of a gas phase;- Development of pop favoured if the output is low or nil (dead end section, upper ttaps of tanks in the gas phase, valves and fittings, etc.);- Cast iron valves and fittings;* Analysis of the risks of the installations based on the following criteria:- Output conveyed;- Nominal diameter;- Line or tank pressure;- Volume involved in case of confinement;- Isolability: is there a means of insulating the critical point, is it accessible in the case of a leak?* Site inventory and analysis: machine checks, verification of the upstream/downstream pressure levels of identified points, manoeuvrability tests of valves and fittings at risk.- Similar configurations have either been removed for verification of the absence of pop, for cleaning where necessary and replacement in certain cases, or a functionality test has been carried out on the valves and fittings, allowing seizing or pop to be detected. In the case of a negative test, the valves/fittings have been removed and cleaned.- The [quarter-turn] valve in question has been replaced by a steel ball valve, pending a detailed study of the problem with the by-pass. Two other cast iron valves have been replaced.- The valve involved in the accident was not classified as critical. At the request of the DRIRE, a "critical valves/fittings" inspection plan has been completed on valves and taps which could present a risk of blocking by pop.Besides, the following additional preventive measures have been implemented:.- 2nd level measures realised by the company's inspection service;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; .- Half-yearly functionality tests during operation;- Half-yearly dismantling for internal inspection during the 2 annual shutdowns.&amp;nbsp; These last two measures are moved forward 3 months, in order to maximise the coverage of risk-relevant fittings- Replacement of the critical gate valves and of the cast iron fittings by steel fittings during the July 2001 plant shutdown;- Study of each dead end section in order to perform modifications during the July 2001 plant shutdown, in order to reduce "pop"-related risk. Lesson learned: the uncontrolled and spontaneous butadiene polymerisation phenomenon is a reality which must be considered and its scenario must be analysed, especially in valves used as bypass.This accident has highlighted organisational and safety culture-related problems which are at present under assessment, which should lead to the issue of a complementary decree within the framework of the decree of 10 May 2000 (Seveso II), as lessons learned from:* The lack of action by personnel during the release,&amp;nbsp; to close a manually operated valve placed between the storage tank and the valve involved in the accident, which could have greatly reduced the quantity of substance released into the atmosphere;*The lack of the analysis of this accident scenario in the risk assessment studies leading to an educational and training gap in the personnel and to the assumption of an explosion hazard in proximity of the site ( resulting in the closure of the TGV high speed train line).* The position of the central command post set up by the operators, which could have been reached by the butadiene cloud* The anxiety among certain members of the population, as a reaction to the butadiene smell, caused by a lack of information.* The ill-defined limit between internal and external emergency plan, depending on the drift of the gas under the influence of changing winds* The improvement of crisis management (decisions were made only after excessive delays)* The interfacing instructions with the national railway company SNCF.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">INTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Before evacuating the control room, operator initiated the emergency shut-down and venting system of the hydrocracker unit. The on-site emergency procedure was activated. This included the shut-down of the entire refinery, the evacuation of non-essential personnel, the mobilization of the refinery fire brigade and the call on-site of engineering management staff. The extensive refinery fire fighting system was quickly brought into use.The area major incident control committee (comprising Police, Fire Brigade and representatives from major companies in the area) was called into operation to co-ordinate the emergency measures. Fire brigades from Central Scotland attended. Supplies of equipment essential for fire fighting were brought on-site from companies in the locality under a mutual aid system. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Road blocks were set up. Occupiers of neighbouring factories were asked to inspect their sites for damages. It was not necessary to evacuate any housing.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: After the accident the following measures were established:
1- during the rebuilding of the hydrocracker, a full pressure relief on the LP separator, as well as improved instrumentation and fail-safe shut-off valves in series with level-control valves to be included;
2- rigorous procedures to be adopted in order to drain the HP separator of liquid as shut-down;
3- the systems for reporting plant defects, for testing interlocks and trips, for authorising equipment changes and for training operators have been tightened up;
4- routine audits to be carried out rigorously. 

Senior management were taking a much closer interest in the safety performance of refinery departments.Useful references: The effects of the LP separator burst was estimated to be equivalent to those caused by an explosion of 90 kg of TNT.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The emergency team and fire brigade responded quickly, notably because the fire station was close by. Their response consisted above all of extinguishing the burning solid objects (wooden palettes etc.) in the corridor of the 5th floor. The authorities were initially unaware that the fumes released by the fire were not toxic. It took some time before it became known that it was a fire fuelled simply by wooden palettes and empty drums/IBCs and did not involve dangerous substances. This slowed down the initial response.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The decomposition temperature of a pure product can be much higher than the decomposition temperature of the same product mixed with other substances. Prior to commencing production, tests should be carried out on the actual mixtures in order to reflect reality more closely. Following the accident, the company repeated the laboratory tests for all production processes that required them. Combustible materials (e.g. wooden palettes) must never be stored in a production building even if it does not contain dangerous substances. The company has created a storage area outside the building. The openings (the glass panels) between the reactor rooms on the fourth floor and the corridor of the fifth floor have also been removed. The operator should be able to see all measurements. The company has made sure that all measurements from the temperature sensors are displayed to the operator.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Considering the dynamics of the accident, the effects, and the information provided by the firefighters teams involved in the emergency procedure, it is possible to say that the internal emergency plan was not really activated, and the external emergency was not adequately and quickly requested by the company. Firefighters were called first only by the citizens of surrounding towns, after seeing and hearing explosion effects. In fact, the local firefighters chief reported that it received one call from a survivor component of the company only after 8 calls of citizens. Moreover, after the first explosions, the missing evacuation of the surviving operators inside the plant led to increase the damages.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">On the basis of information collected and the reconstruction of the hypothetical chain of events , even though the judicial investigation into the accident is still under way, it is possible to point out the following shortcomings in management: it is possible to suppose that the operating procedures deployed by the company were unsafe, as also supported by the conclusions of a previous SMS inspection conducted by local Authority in 2012, which pointed out the absence of adequate operative procedures and instructions for managing the explosives production in safe conditions, in each stage of process; beyond the lack of information and training provided to operators, who as experts in the field may be deemed to be well aware of the dangers of handling primed materials, an excessive level of ‘confidence’, gained over time and perhaps overfamiliarity with work, involving high level of intrinsic risk materials, came out; given the extent of the material damage sustained by external structures impacted by debris from the disintegration of the sheds and protective walls, and based on a damage assessment by applying the TNT equivalent method to the case in point, it may be hypothesized that the quantity of explosive in the stores at the time of the event exceeded the quantity permitted by the competent authorities. This leads to the hypothesis of a breach of safety requirements with regard to the maximum quantities of dangerous substances kept in store and processed; it should be stressed that the safety distances laid down in the National regulations are valid and upheld only if obligations stemming from them and from safety requirements and safety procedures are also systematically complied with; attention should be drawn to the company's deficient in-house management of the emergency, including its failure to call in the emergency services in good time and failure to detect situations requiring the immediate evacuation of the premises: the failure to evacuate staff from the premises after the initial explosions aggravated the damage caused; as for the damage caused by the ejection of debris, attention should be drawn to the lethal effect of the pieces produced by the break up of the roof of shed No&amp;nbsp;8 which, thanks to their strong but thin metal structure (sandwich panels), when ejected at high speed following the shock wave acted like sharp blades, thus causing the death of one employee. Consequently, the technical issue of the construction features of the roofs on the sheds, also raised in discussions with a police bomb expert, should be noted: although this type of roof is adequate in terms of providing protection and a preferential vent for a shed containing explosive material, it may aggravate the effects of an explosion in the shed in which it is broken into fragments; with regard to the difficulty of emergency service and fire service action during the explosions, it is noted that the presence of a second access route to the works, on the opposite side to the first access route, would have facilitated the positioning of fire-fighting equipment and the management of the emergency response and would significantly have reduced the fire-fighting team's risk of exposure to the shock wave and material debris during the operation. In this connection, the effective coordination of the team, with the fire-fighting units positioned and arranged in such a way as to take advantage the protection offered by the variations in altitude of the terrain on which the sheds were located, and the team's use of PPE (safety helmets, etc.) undoubtedly prevented the situation becoming more costly in terms of damage suffered by the fire-fighters.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The pressure tests that were done before the start up were not suitable: test at a pressure lower than the maximum working pressure of the reactor.
There were no written instructions for the workers to inform them about the type of gasket that was needed or the way that the gaskets should by build in (for example torque moment to be used).
Flat non-reinforced gaskets blow-out when they fail, immediately causing a major release. If the old type of gasket: spirally wound, would still have been used, a problem with the gasket had only caused a limited leak.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Raising staff awareness:Prioritisation of upcoming work with line managers at times of excessive workload.New risk assessment in case of changes to planned workflows.
The follow-up to the incident revealed various aspects that can offer lessons for avoiding similar incidents.In the case of atmospheric tanks (flat floor tanks), the vents provided must not be covered or otherwise sealed. Both product intake and removal and temperature variations can create sufficient pressure differentials to jeopardise tank integrity in the absence of ventilation.Changes in workflows, particularly revised implementation or extended duration, mean that particular attention should be paid to communication between contractors and the responsible plant management. Plant management should be aware of the state of the plant and ensure that it is safe.If workloads are heavy, security-related tasks must be performed. This calls for prioritisation to take place with line managers. Achieving this requirement calls for a culture that allows staff to address such situations and managers who possess the awareness to promptly identify the threat of overload.The human factor in safety must not be overlooked.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Operation of the maize silos and the brick silos was authorised progressively.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Onsite the following prevention measures were taken in relation to the pit affected by the accident- simplifying the communication node of the silos - installing a vent on top of the elevator covering all the duct surface and connected to the external atmosphere; the bottom part of the elevator is equipped with surfaces which can be cleaned with compressed air. - the concrete slab of the brick silos ground -floor (ceiling of the elevator pit) has been replaced by a metal structure - separating the reception pit from the silos underground gallery by installing a door - separating the handling tower from the upper cell sections by means of steel lining in order to reduce dust depositing in the tower and limit the propagation of a secondary explosion in case of accident. - creation of position of safety managerIn a wider context the accident occurred in a cereal storage installation which, after the accident at Blaye, had been subject to the intervention of the Classified Installation Inspectorate and to a series of administrative and criminal proceedings. These proved to be insufficient to oblige the operator to take the hazards of the activity correctly into account and to comply in the longer term with the safety regulations. This kind of installation needs permanent monitoring and maintenance of safety procedures.The Regional Inspectorate for Classified Installations (DRIRE) of the Piccardy region has set up an operation called "Silos", consisting in the systematic inspection of all registered silos subject to authorisation over a period of three months. The prefects and the representatives of the professional associations were given advance warning of this operation.Certain reactions opposing the implementation of certain clauses of the ministerial decree of 29th July 1998 were encountered in the first sites inspected. The collective awareness of the problem and of the need to handle the risk at its source however developed rapidly, thanks also to the psychological impact of the ALBET accident, which followed the accident at BLAYE, and to the collective, systematic and demonstrative character of the operation.This explains why at beginning of the operation the average number of non-conformities found during the inspections was 7 whereas it dropped to 4 in August for the last inspections.During this campaign a total of 100 silos with a capacity of more than 15 000 m3 were inspected&amp;nbsp;- 93 reports were issued for 567 offences&amp;nbsp;- 94 proposals were submitted to the prefects &amp;nbsp;- the main non-conformities found were related to the detection of malfunctioning, to the electric systems and to the conveyor systems</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When the contamination of the water in the rainwater drain was detected, it was diverted to the storm-water basin of the waste water treatment plant of the refinery and the pumping from the tanker was stopped.The on-site emergency plan was activated when the fire started on the beach of Aterro. The local authorities were also alerted in order to activate the off-site emergency plan.Extinguishing foam was introduced in the rain water outfall to fight the fire at the beach of Aterro and, after the fire was extinguished, the feeding of foam was maintained in order to assure a complete covering with this extinguishing agent, so as to avoid the release of flammable vapours, which could re-ignite.During the extinguishing operations, approximately 50000 l of foaming agent were used to produce the extinguishing foam.The fire was declared extinguished at 23:45 h.Environmental damage caused by the spill of crude oil was not very serious, because of the amount spilled and the immediate start of operations to reduce the consequences and for restoration.Emergency measures - Remarks: The means involved in the fire fighting operations were the following :-- Human means- 6 members of the security service- 7 members of the emergency response team of the fire brigade- 5 members of the auxiliary group of the fire brigade-- Equipment- 4 fire fighting vehicles- 1 supply vehicle- 1 ambulance- 3 diesel engine generators (U-4501 A ,B, and C)- 1 electric pump (P-4508)- 48500 litres of extinguishing foam extract A3 SPThe chronology of the response operations was as follows:Around 23:05 on 14/10/1998, the Security Service operator appointed to the aromatic compound plant, contacted the shift manager of the Security Service informing him that crude oil was reaching U7000 through the rain water drain. The control room of the Product Handling department was immediately contacted. While the shift manager of the Security Service was going to inspect U7000, the Security Service operator who was already there, he informed the control room over radio that he saw a glimmer on the beach towards U7000.At 23:15, the general alarm of the refinery was released after confirmation of the occurrence by the shift manager of the Security Service.It was ordered to start the production of extinguishing foam with a fire fighting vehicle and to inject the foam in the rain water outfall through the corresponding&amp;nbsp; outlet box .Meanwhile the shift manger of the Security Service instructed the Communication Centre of the Security Service to inform the fire brigade of Matasinhos-Leca as well as to activate the off-site emergency plan.The Security Service team and the members of the emergency response service (of the fire brigade) collaborated in the fire fighting operations, by introducing extinguishing foam into the rain water outfall and by taking preventive measures such as covering with foam the area surrounding the&amp;nbsp; outlet box of that rain water outfall as well as the basins of U 7000 and also by creating water curtains. In order to protect the control room of U 7000 and assure a perfect coverage (protection) of the area of the beach and the sea affected by the spillage, the foam was introduced for a long time in the rain water outfall.At 23:45 the fire was declared extinguished and the situation was completely under control.Due to the continuation of the foam injection, the end of the emergency was formally declared at 01:45 of 15/10/1998.The seriously injured person was evacuated by the National Institute for Medical Emergencies to the Pedro Hispano Hospital and successively to the Unit for severe burns of the Coimbra University Hospital.The body of the deceased person was removed after the legal formalities had been performed in presence of a representative of the state attorney's office and a representative of the municipal health authority; an autopsy was successively carried out on the body at the Institute for Legal Medicine of Porto.The Northern Marine Department was in charge of assessing and controlling the pollution; operations started at 07:00 on 15/10/1998 with the identification of the spots and terminated at 12:00 of the same day by using the following boats: Barra de Leixoes, Barra de Viana, Leao dos Mares. Only one small spot, having an extension of 100 m, was observed near the shore; the spot was thin and not very large and looked like diesel oil. No other spots were detected between the estuary of the Douro river and the area in front of Cabo Mundo.Official action taken - legal action: Judicial investigation carried out by the state attorneyOfficial action taken - other official action: The General Direction of Energy withdrew the operation license of TOL (oil terminal)The Ministry of Economy created an investigation commission to define&amp;nbsp; exhaustively the responsibilities related to the accident. The final recommendations of the related report were the following:Immediate actionsa) complete demolishing of the provisional drainage system up to 10" gate valve connected to the 40" diameter new pipeline.b) Setting up and approval of detailed operational procedures, including the procedures for discharging clean or emulsified water, and foreseeing future situations in which a new hydrostatic test may be requested.c) Development of more effective routines for verifying the technical capability of the tanker to control the pumping flow rates at any given time during discharge operations, if requested by the situation. d) Definition of adequate routines for the documentation of the entire process of working out and authorising operational procedures or working instructions, respective discussion and familiarisation of the workers directly involved (documenting the operation), particularly for exceptional tasks.e) Revoke the withdrawal of the operation license of the TOL (oil terminal), ordered in resolution No. 9/98 of Director General of Energy dated 15/10/1998, considering the necessity to operate TOL (the oil terminal) for supplying the refinery with raw materials; the analysis of the accident causes and all other elements collected during the investigation have clearly established that the operation of TOL (oil terminal) in normal condition does not represent any major risk (the successful unloading of the crude oil after the accident confirms it).Medium term actions:a) Planning of integrated measures for risk assessment inspections, carried out&amp;nbsp; by independent and competent authorities with the goal of assessing the integrity of the existing transfer installation for the crude oil unloaded for the refinery and the respective storage systems, and more specifically with regard to the respective state of corrosion.b) Conclusion of the revision process of procedure DGRP 090.06/19994 - issue and approval&amp;nbsp; of study requests and execution of studies concerning specifically the adoption of appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of operational risks.c) Realisation of an external safety audit of the procedures and processes of the Petrogal Refinery of Porto and publishing of the results.d) Study and revision of the&amp;nbsp; framework for the initial and subsequent licensing procedures for similar installations, considering both the safety aspect and&amp;nbsp; the legal aspect, which normally foresees the appointment of a legal party responsible for collecting all advice involved and the initial definition of all parties to be consulted.&amp;nbsp;- Follow up and verification of the implementation of the actionsThe Investigation Commission proposed the setting up of a follow-up commission,&amp;nbsp; with the participation of the Municipal&amp;nbsp; Chamber of Montesinhos, with the goal of monitoring the implementation of the recommended actions, and in particular of guaranteeing the population the safety conditions which legitimately can be expected from an industrial installation of this type.Concerning the methodology to be adopted for the implementation, it was proposed to work out a report documenting the implementation of the recommended measures, directly under the responsibility of the Refinery Manager.This report will have to document all the measures taken to eliminate the risk of the occurrence of similar accidents and discuss the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time.The report will have to contain at least:- A review of the main and secondary hazard sources- A review of all key factors or critical points identified, all preventive measures&amp;nbsp; taken, the degree of effectiveness of such measures and the possibility of maintaining them over time..- A matrix listing the original recommendations, responsibilities for the implementation, and measures taken to comply with each recommendation. The matrix will also have to include any other measure requested by any other official authority, in the case of there being some.The refinery shall present immediately to the licensing authority, within a period of not more than 8 days, a summary report of all accidents which involved the activation of the on-site emergency plan; this shall not interfere with&amp;nbsp; the works of the Follow-up Commission.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The site alarm system gave an audible warning message for the contingency. The onsite emergency team responded to the alarm. The following steps were taken to stem the flow of PT and mitigate the consequences of the release:· Access to the local effluent pit was closed off.· The entrance from the canal roadway was closed off with sand bags to prevent the spread of the PT. · Attempts were made to close the valve from the local control panel but this was unsuccessful.· Attempts were made to cool the flow using water and CO2 extinguishers thereby solidifying the PT but these were unsuccessful· The emergency team planned to fit an 'outlet line pump blank' but this piece of equipment could not be found.· An absorbent sock and wood shims where inserted directly into the flange but again this did not stop the flow. After 2 -3 hours, it appears that the flow slowed of its own accord&amp;nbsp; to a sufficient level to allow the team to remove the air head to the valve and mechanically close it.Emergency measures - Remarks: When the incident occurred, attempts were made to stop the tank emptying and the leak spreading, but these were inadequate and unsuccessful. There were no injuries during the incident, but during the clean-up operation, blood tests taken from four employees of the contractors carrying out the removal of the solidified para-touluidine were found to have high levels of met haemoglobin and were taken to hospital. Three of them suffered symptoms of ill-health and two were detained overnight and treated with oxygen before being released. No long-term ill-health effects have been identified.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: 
Prevention - standards of isolation on site should be upgraded to
ensure that single valve isolation is not relied upon when carrying out
maintenance work in high hazard areas. 

Mitigation - the emergency equipment (e.g. the 'outlet line pump
blank') should be readily available and appropriately maintained at all
times.
Measures to prevent recurrence: The company was asked to address the following issues identified during the investigation:1. The tank was not kept empty following the discovery of the fault on the pump.2. The tank was kept warm and not allowed to set.3. Impossibility of application of site isolation standards to physical hardware.4. History of pump failure on site.5. Specification of personal protection equipment for fitters was not adequate.6. Risk assessment of isolation was not adequate.7. Isolation procedures were not followed.8. Permit to work was not adequate.9. Freezing of para-toluidine lines was not adequate.10. Isolation of pump under repair was not adequate.11. Emergency measures to stop leakage were not adequate.12. The clean up team used water jetting in the heat of the day.13. The clean up team was not adequately trained to prevent exposure to para-toluidine when removing their personal protective equipment.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The External Emergency Plan (EEP) was then activated by the Venice Prefect’s Office, following notification from the fire brigade. Following intervention by the emergency services, the fire was brought under control at approx. 14:00, and the emergency was declared over at approx. 17:00. The fire brigade then checked the still-active pockets of fire and made the plants safe by: monitoring (using a thermal camera) and cooling one reactor; intervening on one tank on-off valve. The operator, together with the fire brigade, then surveyed the site and the effects of the event in order to begin work to make the site safe, which lasted for 1 month (until all the tanks containing hazardous substances present at the establishment were completely emptied). After the event, the following emergency and environmental operations to make them safe were carried out: a contract was concluded with a company specialising in making sites environmentally safe, resulting in a plan being issued; all tanks were completely emptied and the site was made safe by removing all hazardous substances present at the establishment; the environmental status was continuously monitored during decommissioning activities (hazardous substances possibly present in the air); cleaning of underground utilities, remediation and refurbishment of collection and sewage systems.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
Always conduct a risk analysis on all types of modifications in accordance with the appropriate SMS procedure for management of changes (preliminary risks, risks during implementation and risks during operation), resulting in the identification of preventive and protective measures to be implemented, as well as the related training activities for the staff involved.
Always keep systems subject to modification works under isolated and inert conditions to prevent the environmental conditions from changing, which could lead to the formation of potentially flammable and/or explosive atmospheres.
The work permit process must always pay attention to: checks prior to and/or during the performance of the activities, supervision by the persons responsible and formalisation.
Follow the procedures for the correct positioning of stores of hazardous substances and mixtures on the forecourt (e.g. tanks, drums, IBCs, etc.), including related fire protection systems and equipment, as a result of an appropriate risk analysis.
During inspections by the competent authorities, pay attention to the link between risk analysis and management of changes, including those of a temporary nature, in the fine chemicals sector (batch reactions).
Carry out continuous analysis of the operational experience gained from accidents, near misses and anomalies through the specific SMS procedures, and record in the relevant documentation the causes identified, the substances involved, how the incident happened, how the emergency was managed and the corrective actions implemented, instead of simply describing the events.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Problems encountered by the plant in operating its new pipe turned out to be far more serious than anticipated and the operator was not anticipating starting the pipe up again before September 2003.As the 13 August 2002 emergency measure order expired on 13 September 2002, the operator asked for it to be extended to December 2002. A further emergency measure order proposed by the DRIRE was signed by the Prefect on 17 September 2002:- It took into account the actual characteristics of the effluent, which resulted in an increase in the flow discharged (maximum average flow over 24 h equal to 14,760 m3/d) and the distance at which the pH is over 5.5 being extended from 50 m to 80 m;- It provided for an investigation into the installation of a new emergency, temporary outfall to discharge into Seine Bay, so as to enable investigations to continue on the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode without affecting progress on work to redevelop the port.Up to 31 December 2002, the operator thus discharged its effluent into the Seine, via the old outfall (used before the pipe between the Le Havre site and Hode came into operation) partly isolating it from the work to extend the port of the Le Havre. As the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit could not be operated again before the end of the 3rd quarter 2003, as an intermediate solution the operator confirmed the building of the new outfall. Various procedures under the regulations lead to temporary approval of:- Firstly the discharge of effluent into the Seine estuary,- Secondly the alteration of the point of discharge into Seine Bay.The operator thus had to stop discharging into Seine Bay up to 2 January 2004 and bring the pipe between the Le Havre plant and the Hode neutralisation unit back into operation.Furthermore, as there had been a number of incidents at the site in a few months, the 21 October 2002 Prefect's emergency measures order specified an audit of its Health, Safety and Environment management system in order to ensure that it was adequate and functioning correctly.Lastly, the Prefect signed an order on 12 December 2002 requiring a review of all hazard surveys relative to the Le Havre site. This was because the last hazard surveys undertaken were specific to certain units and were more than five years old. In view of the various incidents that had occurred at the site, it appeared necessary to take stock of all hazards at the site and not just at some units.Technically speaking, the operator has replaced all leaking pipes. On 22 July 2003, the pipe successfully underwent a further test with water at a pressure of 15 bars maintained for 2 hours. Tests with acidic water were conducted from early August 2003, two other pipes at high points were damaged and have been repaired. In November 2003, the plant was stopped as the acid production unit was being serviced. New trials are scheduled for when acid effluent is available again.Finally, an additional order by the Prefect was made on 8 March 2004. It requires a new transport pipe to be brought into operation before 30 June 2006. It will follow the route of the old pipe and will be made or high density poly-ethylene (HDPE), not LFG.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The lessons to be learned from this series of incidents cover both the technical domain and also the organisational aspect.TechnicallyAlthough the pipes and their assembly complied with the provisions in the regulations as required by the order, which was conformed on 16 July 2002 by a satisfactory resistance test, that the installation of the pipe and pressure control systems were not, however, in accordance with good custom and practice (non-compliance with the specification as regards installing, incorrect sizing of the buffer chamber and under-estimate of the number of vents).On the evidence, the management of project, which involved various parties (internal and external engineering departments, the fabricator of the pipe, civil engineering contractors appointed and their subcontractors, operator), was the cause of several of the faults, in particular, in the systematic pre-checking of calculations, the installation conditions for the pipe and compliance with various rules for pressurising the facility.Financial aspectsThe series of incidents resulted in substantial costs for the operator (business interruption, repairing leaks, changes to the discharge point into Seine Bay, investigations after incidents, repairing the pipe,#). For example, shortening the old outfall and remaking a diffuser cost&amp;nbsp; 329,300 # excluding VAT, and setting up the new discharge point has been estimated at 5,500,000 #. For economic reasons, this work had to be done as temporary replacement of the new pipe between the Le Havre plant and Hode and would never have been undertaken if the new pipe had been operational from the 3rd quarter 2002.Organisational aspectsThe operator's HSE management system required improvements.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The alarm was quickly changed to an evacuation alarm, with a subsequent message over the Public Announcement system to evacuate the plant. Control room operators then initiated emergency shutdown (ESD2), notified the emergency services (triple notification) and started up the plant's active fire protection system (fixed monitors, programmed with oscillation). At the same time as ESD2 was activated, there was a power failure both in the plant and in parts of the nearby town. ESD2 caused all the turbines to lose supply of flue gas, and the power supply to the plant was cut off. This further resulted in the shutdown ofcooling water and instrument air.&amp;nbsp;
The emergency response team (ERT) and incident management team (IMT) mustered in accordance with theinstructions. It was decided to use firefighting vessels to extinguish the fire instead of sending the local Fire Brigade into the plant out of consideration for the safety of the personnel. After these vessels had been in operation, the local&amp;nbsp;fire brigade went into action at about 22.35 and foamed the area. In the emergency log, it is noted that the fire was confirmed extinguished at 23.20.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In the report entitled Risk assessment report: major accident risks and the consequences of major accidents (August 2010), the plant operator concluded that a hypothetical explosion in building B or G would be fatal (0.14&amp;nbsp;bar) at a distance of up to 173&amp;nbsp;m, cause irreversible injuries (0.07&amp;nbsp;bar) up to 281&amp;nbsp;m and cause reversible injuries (0.03&amp;nbsp;bar) up to&amp;nbsp;533 m. The owner of the fireworks business is under investigation for multiple counts of manslaughter and criminal negligence resulting in a major accident. The plant area was ordered to be cordoned off. The plant’s safety management system was audited in 2012, revealing major technical and management weaknesses with regard to safety issues. These weaknesses, with specific reference to health and safety for the protection of workers, were also highlighted by the local health authority following its inspection of safety conditions at the business.
The proceedings are ongoing and the expert witnesses appointed by the parties have not yet submitted their reports.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Alarm by gas detectors in the area.
A major leak is being reported that cannot be approached.
Intervention team is installing a water screen for dilution of the vapor cloud
Activation of emergency stops of different parts of the installation by Central Control Room operators due to multiple gas alarms and after confirmation of internal fire brigade
Evacuation alarm is given
Phase 2 of the internal emergency plan is activated. 13.55
Monitoring of pressure profiles allows diagnosing were the leak is situated. This diagnose is confirmed by visual observations outside by maintenance and production people. The exact location of the leak is fine-tuned to be on a 2” drain valve on a blow down line.
The lead is isolated. Since there is no isolation valve between the section with the leak and the next section both have to be emptied to stop the leak. 15.00
The pressure in the system has fallen from 32 bar to 2.4 bar 18.00
The pressure drops quickly to ± 0.1 bar after opening of a blow down.
Scaffolding is erected and the leaking 2” valve is replaced. The replaced 2” valve with studs and nuts is recovered for further investigation.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

Quality control of delivered materials and equipment parts.
Quality control of installed materials in the field by additional controls (e.g. supervision, Positive Material Identification). Organization of campaign to raise awareness about galvanic corrosion
During the incident investigation, it became clear that the risks associated to galvanic corrosion are not always clearly understood by all layers of the organization. To raise understanding and awareness about galvanic corrosion hazards, a sensibilisation campaign needs to be organized by the site. Development of formal protocol for visual inspection of valves
There is no formal procedure describing the visual inspection of equipment. To improve the quality of visual inspections during site visits, a formal protocol needs to be developed to describe the requirements related to visual inspection. This formal protocol needs to include specific a measurable acceptance criteria for each of the inspected equipment. Gas detection
The gas detection system in the installation gave a quick warning of the leak allowing prompt action by the unit operators. It took a long time to depressurise the section of the installation with the leak. Partly because of the white cloud formed by the leak that didn't allow visual verification of the leak origin. Partly because there was no block valve on the top of the destillation colomn to which the leaking valve was connected. Therefore also the following equipement needed to be depressurised. The need for an additional block valve is still under investigation.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: Due to the fact that it can't be absolutely excluded that smaller accidents can occur in installations of this type, even with all foreseen precautions, a better co-ordination of the offsite emergency response actions with those foreseen onsite the establishment would be appropriate. The emergency should be managed by an unique coordination centre coordinating the local structures involved.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The company must nominate one person who is responsible for waste water management and for compliance of release limits for industrial waste water.
The homogenisation bowl has to be started again immediately.
The company must organize an internal audit about waste water purification.
Measure devices (TCO meters) must be maintained periodically following a defined procedure. An alarm should be raised not only at too high values but also in case of failure (values abnormally low). In case of alarm the purification unit and release into Meuse has to be stopped.
A continuous measurement of waste water quality must be installed.
An electronic transfer of TCO values will be installed between the company and the Environmental Police. In case of river pollution, the Environmental Police will see immediately the data of the purification unit from CHIMAC SA.
Installation of a TCO meter before purification. Knowing the purification capacity of carbon filters, this TCO meter can be used to verify if the pollutant load can be purified.

Complementary actions :
8.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;A better communication must be established between production units in order to detect anomalies in the pesticide transfer as fast as possible.
Lessons learnedA pesticide production company contains permanent ecological risks. The least lack of vigilance can have very high consequences. There is a need of clear and precise internal procedures. Operators must be perfectly trained and made aware of existing risks. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

With the help of a checklist they can ensure that all the relevant operations in different duties are correctly and sequentially be executed. 5) Valves might be grouped and possibly marked with colours. Therefore process state can be clearly seen as valves would be clearly identified.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

consult with the company on measures to prevent future incidents.Measures to prevent recurrence: The problem is mainly of communicative nature between the owner and leasing companies. It could be avoided in the future if all rail tank cars were accompanied by a car specific rail book containing maintenance, cleaning and (un)loading records. Furthermore, a rail tank car should not be used for temporary storage, unless additional measures have been taken to ensure the same safety level as a storage tank.Measures to mitigate consequences: The company could have placed more gas detection heads (all around the loading station instead of just at one point).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The management of the residue incinerator informed staff about the incident and its causes.
The operating instructions for emptying the Trapos have been supplemented so that clearance from the shift leader is now required before N2&amp;nbsp;‘back flushing’ is carried out if a riser/connecting arm is believed to be obstructed. The process should additionally be supervised by staff on the process control system (in particular monitoring weight decrease).
The operator will schedule a meeting soon with the waste supplier to come up with a retrofittable technical solution (e.g. differing connector sizes) to prevent Trapo connectors from being confused again in the future.

- In addition to the cut-offs that had already been installed (pressure cut-off inlet low/outlet high, bearing lubricant oil temperature high/oil pressure low, axial thrust high), a temperature monitor has been fitted to the fire/noise protection casing of the blower, with an alarm in the measuring station, in order to be able to detect an increase in temperature even earlier, if necessary.
- There are important supply lines in the area of the blowers. A sprinkler system will be installed there as soon as possible in order to be able to provide intensive cooling in a short space of time. Water is supplied both by means of a fixed pipeline (deionised water network) and by means of a water hydrant, which can be connected by the fire brigade in an emergency.
- The safe operation of the flares was discussed in detail with the operator. In order to optimise ignition of the burners, a trial is being carried out on one acetylene flare and one lean gas flare in which conventional ignition is replaced by self-priming, electric ignition that does not rely on compressed air.

isolated the affected part of the process from the rest of the process (this isolation was initially ineffective as it relied on a valve that turned out not to be leakproof);
rendered that part inert by injecting nitrogen;
opened a valve to release the gas from that part towards the flare;
drained off the liquid phase.
At 11.30 a.m., the site firefighters stopped the ignited leak by installing a valve. This was done with the protection of a water curtain and the rendering of the gas inert with nitrogen.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After the accident happened, the local government urgently evacuated more than 6,000 students and residents of nearby schools and residential areas. While firefighters put out the fire caused by the explosion, the firefighting water carried unburned benzene (about 4t) into Guixi River in Xinmin Town, threatening the downstream drinking water sources (Guixi River flows into Caojia River which flows into Gaotan River. Although there is no drinking water fetching point along Gaotan River, the river flows into Longxi River, along which a downstream lake called Changshou Lake is the drinking water fetching point of Changshou District of Chongqing. The drinking water fetching point is about 123km from the explosion place).
Based on the site pollution situation and the pollution handling progress, the emergency command headquarters took a series of effective measures:
1) It ordered the downstream Changshou District to closely monitor the river water at the point where the river flows into the territory of the district; once an excessive concentration of benzene was found, monitoring workers were instructed to immediately report this to the district government and release information to the public about the situation of the drinking water source;
2) It ordered the government of Dianjiang County to completely isolate the pollutants at the accident site and to handle the isolated benzene;
3) It ordered various levels of local environmental protection departments to closely monitor the environment, to closely track the movement and concentration change of the pollutants, to predict the diffusion trend of the benzene pollutant according to the hydrological parameters of the river, and to timely evaluate the blockade and adsorption effect of pollutants along the river; and
4) It closed the waterlocks of Gaoan Dam and Gaodong Dam in the upstream of Changshou Lake to cut off water flowing into the territory of the Changshou District, ensuring that the pollutants would be blocked within the upstream river of Gaodong Dam and preventing the pollutants from entering the Changshou Lake.
After five days of salvage and adsorption, most of benzene was adsorbed, rescued and evaporated within the Caojia River, and only a small amount (about 63kg according to estimates and calculation) entered Gaotan River; after multiple layers of adsorption and treatment, the pollutants were basically eliminated between the Sanhe Estuary of Gaotan River and Gaoan Dam. As of 4:00 pm on Nov. 29, after more than 40 hours of continuous emergency treatment, no benzene was detected in the entire Gaotan River. The threat of the pollutants downstream of the Gantan River had already been eliminated. The pollutants did not affect the Longxi River and the Changshou Lake, which is a drinking water source for residents of Changshou District. At 7:00 pm on Nov. 29, Chongqing municipal government finally lifted the alarm related to the environmental pollution caused by the explosion accident. Environmental protection departments of both Chongqing Municipality and Dianjiang County responded rapidly, organizing environmental monitoring workers to deploy 10 monitoring points within an about 100km range along Caojia River, Gaotan River and Longxi River to continuously monitor the water quality and to closely track the drift of the pollution belt. The Dianjiang county government immediately set up an accident rescue and investigation group and took effective measures to prevent the diffusion of pollutants. In the 24km-long Caojia River, the group urgently used straw, activated carbon and charcoal to build 9 dams to block pollutants from drifting downstream.

&amp;nbsp;SIA’s Accident Investigation, icl. Recommendations 
//SIA= Safety Investigation Authority. In Finland the Safety Investigation Authority investigates all major accidents regardless of their nature as well as all aviation, maritime and rail accidents and their incidents
There were two major industrial fires in the Finnish region of Satakunta in late January 2017 and SIA investigated the accident together. Only one of them occured in Seveso site.&amp;nbsp;Chapters 3 and 4 contains information about the Huntsman’s accident. Analysis, conclusions and recommendations are common to the two different industrial fires.

&amp;nbsp;
The SIA's recommendations (The Safety Investigation Authority):
The Safety Investigation Authority made&amp;nbsp;safety recommendations for the improvement of industrial fire safety and the prevention of similar accidents:
1. The&amp;nbsp;SIA recommends that, together with the Rescue Department, the Ministry of the Interior ensures that, in their rescue planning, industrial premises prepare for fires identified as longer-lasting or more extensive, or other dangerous situations of this kind.
In their rescue plans, neither industrial plant had prepared for extensive, long-lasting incidents requiring special management measures, cooperation, a range of preparations and, for example, the arrangement of replacement personnel and maintenance.
2.&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;SIA recommends that the Rescue Departments’ partner network plans arrangements based on which the use of foam as an extinguishing agent is always fast and thorough, and ask the rescue departments to implement such arrangements.
Water is the primary extinguishing agent in rescue operations, but water is not very suitable for extinguishing burning liquids. Strong preparedness to use foam is required in such situations. The need to use foam should be identified as soon as possible and the foam should be fired quickly, based on a simple command.
3. The SIA also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplements the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.
Plastic pipelines were running along the roof of the titanium dioxide plant and the fire spread rapidly along them. Burning plastic fell from the pipelines onto the roofing material, which caught fire.
&amp;nbsp;

The Safety Investigation Authority also recommends that the Ministry of the Environment supplement the instructions included in the fire safety regulations for buildings, which stipulate that the principles of fire compartmentalisation also apply to external pipelines and other installations.

Thorough check of all the areas in which following operations take place: production, processing and storage of explosives, focusing on the areas where this substances may accumulate (incl. sewage system, ventilation ducts);
Verification of the documentation/procedures including adequacy of methods used for cleaning the equipment and facilities; procedures the unusual situations to be introduced in the documentation;
Training of the staff responsible for preparation of facilities/buildings and objects for maintenance works.

Moreover the Competent Authority issued the following reccomendations to the operator:

Verify the way of preparation for maintatnce works for installations and objects in which explosives occour, particularly concerning the assesment of cleaning methods used in the plant in order to remove explosives's residues potentailly present;
Strenghen the supervision on the contractors performing works on the site;
In the newly designed and renovated objects in which realese of explosives may occour, use the floor and canals constructed with non-absorbing materials guaranteeing its tightness and impenetrability for dangerous substances.

In this case, for example, sound emission tests would be one way of promptly detecting the formation of corrosion voids behind the cladding.- The age of the equipment certainly plays an important role, as more modern containers are usually equipped with 100% stainless steel blind flanges.- The lessons can also be applied to reactors with other corrosion-resistant coatings.- Where damage to the protective layer may occur, as a result of which the more sensitive layer is exposed and the damage is not detected in good time, a disastrous break-through and release of substances can occur. Accordingly, the maintenance and inspection plans relating to such systems must be reviewed and, if necessary, amended.- Aging installations for which complete history documentation may not be available must be treated with a commensurate level of caution.Examine whether additional gas sensors in the area of cooking acid treatment can help to locate leaks more quickly.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After the incident happened, various levels of local environmental protection departments rapidly started the environmental emergency response mechanism and hurried to the incident site. After receiving a report about the incident, Yanshi Environmental Protection Bureau quickly reported it to Luoyang Environmental Protection Bureau and organized relevant personnel to hurry to the incident site at 2:10 am. It then reported the site situation to Luoyang Environmental Protection Bureau and the provincial environmental protection department by phone. Leaders of Luoyang Environmental Protection Bureau led a batch of environmental emergency supervision and monitoring staff, bringing emergency environmental monitoring equipment to the site at 3:40 am and worked with Yanshi Environmental Protection Bureau to coordinate the action. Local government and relevant departments were contacted to urgently mobilize large-scale equipment and more than 100 emergency workers. They first built a dam in the plant's drainage ditch to block polluted water from flowing into Yihe River. Then, they used 3t activated carbon and 20t quicklime to pretreat the blocked polluted water, controlling the polluted water before it flowed into Yihe River. After receiving relevant reports, officials of the provincial environmental protection department visited the incident site at 6:00 am and suggested strengthening the blockage of the polluted water and to scientifically deploy monitoring points.Chlorobenzene, nitrochlorobenzene and 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene can easily float on the water surface, therefore building three dams and casting activated carbon and quicklime into the water are a good option to dispose them. Sending sludge and polluted soil into the incinerator of a cement plant cannot cause secondary pollution. Under the unified command of the local government, local environmental protection, police, firefighting and work safety departments quickly took effective measures to control the fi re and pollution in a relatively short period of time, timely publishing relevant information to the society and stabilizing public opinion. Timely notifying the society of the aftermath environmental situation, especially the safety of the drinking water and the quality of the air, as well as of the effective measures taken by various government departments and their effects, can eliminate the worries and concerns of the masses and maintain social stability and the local people's environmental rights.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Technology related recommendations:

Adequacy of ventilation must be monitored regularly
Pressure relief must be designed and carried out so that the buildup of pressure cannot cause collapse of structures or buildings, or damage to pipelines
There must be enough gas detectors in facilities where explosive mixtures may be present
Alarms from gas detectors must be detectable in all places where workers may be in danger and near entrance doors.
Vertical lift doors are not suitable as emergency exits
The amount of hazardous chemicals in the production facilities should be limited to be as low as possible (e.g. the needs of one shift).
It is recommended to attach the gas alarm to the safety automation system, e.g. to de-energize electrical equipment and close valves

Recommendations related to organizational activities:

Tasks that are meant to ensure safety must be identified, as well as workers who are responsible for the execution of these tasks
The management must supervise that these tasks are carried out
The company must be aware of the legislation that regulates its activities
The company must systematically monitor how the implementation of demands and recommendations from authorities are carried out
Systematic maintenance must be carried out. Records must be kept of all implemented maintenance activities
The workers must be trained to work safely, and they must be told about the plant’s hazards. Temporary workers must also be trained.
The company must inform the supervising authority when changes are made that concern the handling and storage of hazardous chemicals.

The external emergency Plan prearranged by the Prefettura has been activated for event classified of II category with: - block of the railway path, since a part of the railroad crosses the establishment; - block of the circulation on the roads surrounding the refinery; - limitation of several operations in the near airport of Falconara, without practical consequences; - interruption of the power supply of the 132 Kv line running along the railroad; - activation of the center of joint advanced coordination; - activation of the procedures of information to the population. The fire has been attacked with water and foam coming from fire brigade equipment VVFs (among which two hydrofoam AIS-tankers of the airport type) and from the fixed networks of the factory, while they devoted the efforts to cool the reservoirs and tankers located near the area affected by the event. After around 2 hours from the beginning of the fire the hotbed was under control and the railway circulation had been reactivated. After around 3 hours complete flames extinguishing had been reached. The operations are concluded with the restoration of the safety conditions of the plant as in the respect of the directives released by the judicial authority, which has set the whole area under sequestration Official action taken - legal action: The judicial trial, still in progress, had started immediately after the incident; the area of the firm involved in the accident is so far still under sequestration. Official action taken - other official action: The CTR (Technical Expert) Marche, tasked of the legal preliminary inquiry of the safety report, right after the event has instructed the operations manager to: - prearrange the detailed technical incident report, including the engineering features about bitumen handling operations in similar firms - revise the safety report - requesting the MATT of a new verification inspection on the SGS - short/medium range adoption of the following preventive/mitigative measures: - loading platform tankers relocation away from the storage area, within the framework of the renovation project of the portion of the plant involved in the accident - verification of the safety conditions of the entire hot oil circuit in the refinery - improving the inside Emergency Plan, with particular reference to the response times of the internal and external personnel located in the factory as well as to the interface and communications between the local rescue and national domestic fire brigade teams Discussion about response: Here below follows the chronological summary of the management of the emergency based on: - recordings and reports of the General Coordinator of the Emergency (CGE) - information collected by the gatehouse personnel on duty - information picked up by the field operational personnel involved in the management of the emergency - printouts of the internal and external recording of the telephone traffic Particularly: ~ 07,25 - alarm message, received by the field, is released from the gatehouse through the emergency telephone system (222) ~ 07.27 - the Emergency Control Room Center (CCE) is opened by the Emergency General Coordinator (CGE). ~ 07.27 - National fire Brigade (VVF) call the Refinery, through a dedicated fixed line, to ask whether an emergency is in progress; the gatehouse responds affirmatively ~ 07.27 - the CGE communicates his installation as the field emergency coordinator (CEC) who answers providing the category of the accident (2°) and reporting there are injured people; the gatehouse alerts the internal medical facility, requesting the operation of the local ambulance operation as well as the national emergency telephone number 118 ~07.28 - the CGE requests the emergency routes to be opened by the gatehouse ~ 07.28 - the CGE requests the gatehouse to activate the foreseen communications in the PEI for a category 2 accident; the gatehouse activates all the calls foreseen, except the National Fire Brigade (VVF), already called.

For safety assurance standard regular controls the area have been arranged by the fire brigade personnel.Seveso II duties - remarks: The essential components of the
outside emergency plan have been examined during the verification
performed by the inspectors on the safety management system (June
2001). The technical information for the implementation of the law
related to the monitoring of the new building operations (industrial
and civil urbanization) have been prearranged by the operational
management and forwarded to the CTR in December 2002 for examination.
The RdS (safety report, ndr) has been revised in June 2004 before the
five years expiration foreseen by law, and is still in the evaluation
phase. In the RdS it has been assumed the hot oil release in the
affected unit and the following fire, but without bitumen involvement
since it is a substance not listed in the attachment I of the Directive
96/82.
As far as point c is concerned, it is not possible to point out a
correlation among the organizational and managerial elements with the
accident since the causes are not been identified yet.

The water spray system went into operation. The source of the release
was identified 45 minutes after the leakage was detected; the leaking
pipeline was isolated soon after that. The company firemen checked the
roads around the factory with explosimeters and the response was
negative everywhere. Besides, they irrigated the area where the leakage
occurred and made a screen from each side. The Security chief called
Service 100 to signal the leak and to ask the firemen to take up
position around the factory in case gas layer moved to the outside.
EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:
Sambreville fire brigade was called and took position around the plant
fence on the side opposite the site of the leak but its intervention
was not necessary, since repeated gas concentration measurements at the
boundary of the factory resulted negative. The railway traffic in the
city of Jemeppe was interrupted during the accident, from 23:32 till
03:08 next morning. The goods trains were stopped where they were

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The safety devices reacted in accordance with their intended functions. The bursting disc of the reactor (set pressure 0.8 bar) was, however, undamaged. As it was not contaminated, the pressure must have remained in the reactor 0.5 &lt; p &lt; 0.8 bar, before the cooling coil broke. The pneumatic stop valve of the water addition was closed automatically by the detected increase of pressure (with p &gt; 0.2 bar). The fire brigade was automatically alerted and took further action in conjunction with the police. The plant management and the company management were notified via the emergency and incident management system, as were the other people flagged for notification in the system. On-site:
Sealing off and evacuation of the premises.
Fresh air from outside was used to dispel the polluted indoor air until the smell of hydrogen chloride in the building was very faint. Until that point, gas masks had to be worn by those entering the area.
The fire brigade sprayed the building with water to condense any remaining
hydrogen chloride gas or hydrochloric acid vapour.
The resulting precipitation in the operating area was
collected in a chemical catch basin and was channelled into the public sewage system after pH tests.
Restoration:
Residue from the reaction product had to be removed from the entire facility and the facility inspected for damage. Damaged parts were then replaced. Off-site:
-	Surrounding roads sealed off.
-	Order to keep doors and windows in the surrounding area closed (including radio announcements).

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Revision of the PAAG (hazard and operability study) concerning this process to take particular account of operating errors and balanced measures.
The PAAG revealed that the process for adding water must be technically restructured such that the maximum quantity that can be added at one time is limited to 3 litres. This happens through a second glass vessel with a maximum volume of 3 litres situated between the initial glass vessel and the exhaust pipes. Likewise, the shut-off valve to the reactor and the shut-off valve to the initial glass vessel are connected to each other, so that only one of them can be open at any one time. The buttons for operating these two valves are installed within sight of the valves so that permanent visual control by operators is ensured. This also limits the maximum amount that can be added to 3 litres and prevents recurrence of this operating error.
The operator carrying out the task must ensure, before the addition of water commences, that the dispensing valve is closed. This check must be consciously performed and documented from now on.
The PAAGs of other chemical reactions will be examined for potential operating errors. Findings from the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment, Land Surveys and Nature Protection:
One of the main lessons from this incident is that there must be a balanced relationship between recognised danger points and the measures selected to manage them. In the event of a potential loss of control over the reaction process, only inherently secure process configurations or protection through PCE devices should be selected. When designing PCE devices, the reliability and inertia of the entire system must be taken into account. Coupling of the room ventilation system to the fire alarm system.
Review of the information procedure for notifying the affected neighbourhood – completing the list of contacts, and optimisation of the telephone notification chain.

The two departmental roads leading to the site were closed for 12.5 hours. Access to the tank farm was restricted.
The fire brigade reached the surroundings of the site at around 3.40 a.m. with 120 firefighters and 64 fire engines. Their intervention in support of the site’s firefighters began at around 7.30 a.m. Taking water from the nearby lagoon, six 1.8 km long hoses fed one high-powered foam fire engine and three foam units.
Putting out the fire in the first tank (gasoline) was prioritised. The fire in that tank was extinguished at 4.35 a.m. after a massive foam attack by the site’s firefighters. A foam layer was maintained until 12.00 p.m. Work to extinguish the second tank (naphtha) began at 6.20 a.m. and ended at 11.15 a.m. A foam layer was maintained until 3.00 p.m. Its floating roof sank 48 hours later. The structure of the two tanks stayed intact. The external emergency services departed the site at around 8.30 p.m. 170&amp;nbsp;m³ of foam was used.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

First, a fire fighting vehicle from Chateau-Renault arrived on-site. Since the accident led to the rupture of three fire hydrants, two lances were installed taking water from the Brenne river, 500 metres away. After, a fire fighting vehicle from Amboise arrived and 4 lances were in operation. Meanwhile, the fire covered a surface of about 2,000-3,000 m2. Later, when 2 foam guns from Tours and 2 foam tankers arrived on-site, they were put in operation with positive effects due to the synthetic foam used. The water used to cool these vessels and to extinguish the fire (500-600m3/h) caused the pollution of the Brenne river crossing the site. A dike was built a few hours after the fire started to prevent discharge of used fire fighting water to this river. Despite these measures, phenols were found in Loire river fed by the Brenne river.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:Owing to the formation of a toxic cloud inside the building, at about 05:00 the Mayor of Chateau-Renault decided to evacuate a building where 200 handicapped people were housed. Analyses of the cloud composition had been performed every half an hour. Those analyses revealed the presence of hydrogen cyanide, carbon oxide, nitrogen oxides and halogens. At 08:30 the analysis revealed only some traces of carbon oxide. As phenols were found in Loire river (fed by the Brenne river) the authorities decided to interrupt the distribution of drinking water to 200,000 people.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).Official action taken - other official action: The inquiry discovered the total lack of an internal emergency plan and violation of the existing safety rules.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

Two valves could be closed from a safe location.
A third valve was closed in the installation by production personnel that entered the danger zone. Personnel needs to be aware of the danger of such operations.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

After the identification of leakage source, some methods for stopping the hexane leakage have been evaluated but the explosion occurred before any action could be carried out.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The fire brigade and the police were alarmed by a bus driver who smelt hexane vapours outside the plant and was informed by the operating staff for the possible danger. The police barred the area and the fire brigade were preparing for action when the explosion occurred. Approximately 20 people of police and fire brigade personnel were mobilised.Remarks: When the hexane concentration in the extraction building reached a dangerous level the staff was forced out of the building (code 7401). The sprinkler system below the extractor was activated by the hot hexane/steam mixture released through the flap valve (code 7102). The operating staff left the facility and from the Gate called in assistance of staff which were not on duty, including the chief plant operator (code 7107). A bus driver informed the Traffic Control Center of the possible danger, which in turn alarmed the Police and the Fire Brigade (code 7203 and 7201). Approximately 20 people of police and fire brigade personnel were mobilised. The first Fire Brigade unit arrived and decided to call in further assistance. The Police barred the area (code 7208). The Chief Plant Operator (CPO) and the Fire Inspector on Duty, after the leakage source was located (code 7999), discussed how to stop the outflow of hexane vapours and decided to cut-off the power supply (code 7999). The power plant engineer was called to do it but, due to the inherent risk of possible sparks he rejected to stop the loaded transformers and, instead, for unknown reasons, disconnected a third unloaded transformer (this was probably the ignition source for the vapour cloud). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After this accident, it has been decided that this plant will not be rebuilt.MEASURES TO PREVENT ANY RECURRENCE OF SIMILAR ACCIDENTS:Following a visit of an expert group set up in France to establish new Safety Guidelines for extraction facilities in 1985, the following conclusions and recommendations have been considered for preventing similar accidents:1- release of gas from the safety flap must occur in a safe location;2- improvements for the design of the extractor building and its ventilation system would be necessary;3- improvements of the safety and interlock systems;4- improvements of gas detection and fire protection systems;5- improvement of the safety management.Useful references: More detailed information about the accident are contained in the document "Ekplosionsulykken pa Dansk Sojakagefabrik" of July 15, 1980.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Lessons learned:

It is necessary to identify risks in order to introduce appropriate and robust mitigation measures, e.g. design, procedures, etc.
Dangers caused by the release of substances are not necessarily limited to the primary medium in which they are contained.
Opening the system with only a single block in the process is a risk, which requires particular consideration and for which measures appropriate to the operating permit must be introduced.
A high level of risk-awareness — including for routine work and the associated danger of risk normalisation — is required.
For hazardous activities, the worst-case scenario must be borne in mind.
Details recorded in shift logs can also assist with early identification of risks.
Tightening of a shut-off valve when the system is open can cause a sudden increase in the size of a leak.
Following training, checks are required to encourage the use of training content in the field.

Measures:

Risk awareness programme focusing on single block systems, ‘worst-case’ thinking, on-site inspection of hazardous activities, raising awareness of risk normalisation and communicating and discussing lessons learned from this incident.
Improvements in organisation and procedures: specification of more intensive risk analysis criteria as part of the operating authorisation procedure, improved communication during shift changeover, following up on training and revising the procedures concerned.

Technology: improved pipe routing and installation of a double block on these pumps, assessment of further technological measures and development of criteria for a subsequent review of technologically similar systems.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The work to be performed will be defined in a checklist and documented immediately after completion of the work..- The communication system between RWE and the company's power control room has been further improved.- RWE has technically modified the excitation equipment regulator for the gas turbines in such way that brief voltage drops in the generator should no longer cause blackouts.Further measures:- The availability of the cooling water supply is to be improved, and in particular the capacity to start up more quickly after a blackout. The same goes for the compressed air and nitrogen supply.- Further consideration is being given to improving the breathing air supply network, but no conclusion has yet been reached. The current system has a reserve of approx. 10 minutes. - Possible improvements to the compressor cooling system in the air separation plant are also to be investigated.- Regulation of the safety setting of flares in the event of power failures must be reviewed. It may be necessary to fit manual valves on certain flares to manually regulate the air/vapour supply. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

They brought the fire under control and put it out at 1:10 p.m., thus saving the office building and all of the servers. The buildings with the highest risk profile (due to being used to store hazardous materials) were not affected. Soaking of the area continued until the next day. The firewater was collected in retention tanks. The initial atmospheric measurements did not reveal any particular impact from the accident.
The road passing in front of the building was closed and a diversion was put in place.
Four homes were locked down as a precaution.
After the event, the prefect issued an order imposing emergency measures regulating the management of the waste and firewater and ordering dispersion modelling of the plume. The conditions for the parcel/pallet delivery service to restart were also set.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">For the reconstruction of the building, the operator planned to:

change the fire detection procedure (alarm siren, check to rule out false alarm);
install a sprinkler system in the building;
change the internal emergency plan (incorporating the building into the plan, changing the procedure for managing the keys to trucks);
have a battery room adapted to lithium-ion batteries.

Stoppage of U-2000 (ethylene oxide and glycols plant) and stoppage of steam production boilers.
The limits of the battery of all plants (ethylene oxide and derivatives) are closed.
The pumps of the propylene oxide sphere are also stopped and blocked.
The ethylene oxide pumps to plants and customers are blocked.
Disconnection of all electrical substations that feed derivatives plants.
In-plant equipment cooling: propylene oxide tank.
Cool the propylene oxide tank without extinguishing the flame to avoid the release of gases and the possible toxic cloud.
Nitrogen was also injected to achieve an inert atmosphere inside the tank.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
With the advance of the emergency, the flame was extinguished, and from that moment on, the atmosphere was controlled without detecting significant exposure to the product.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">- During the events, protective measures by the operator were not possible (see safety measures).- Retrieval of dried digestate from the fertiliser storage hall to prevent further formation of ember nests.- Restoration of the power supply after the all-clear was given at the fire site. As a result, the flare was brought back into operation.- Ensuring that flare operation is guaranteed by providing an emergency power generator.Measurement by the fire brigade of the sulphur [dioxide] content of the air downwind.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to reduce the risk of fire in the vicinity of the biogas plant:- Modernisation of drying equipment. In future, a so-called Mississippi dryer will be used instead of a belt dryer. Instead of completely drying part of the digestate to a dry matter content of 98%, the digestate is only concentrated and then pumped back to the repository. In future, therefore, there will be no need to store dried digestate. Moreover, unlike the belt dryer technology, there are as yet no known cases of fire caused by a Mississippi dryer.- The storage of sulphuric acid in large quantities is also no longer necessary. Although H2SO4 is still needed, it is no longer stored in advance but delivered in IBC containers as required.- A meeting was organised. The operator, the competent administrative authority, the local mayor and the officers of the nearby voluntary fire brigades took part. It was possible to put together a number of recommendations on how the operator could optimise the conditions for fire extinguishing operations. In particular, the operator has agreed to extend the local area’s fire-fighting pond and thus improve the supply situation of the entire local area.On 6 October 2016 an external institute was commissioned to update the existing fire protection plan. The above-mentioned requirements are included in the planning application and will be implemented in the reconstruction.
Measures to prevent biogas emission:- An emergency generator on the plant site continues to provide additional safety of electricity supply to the plant and to the gas flare.- The use of a gas camera confirmed the integrity of the gas storage membrane.- As part of the process of increasing flexibility, the operator plans to build another external gas storage tank on the site. Therefore, should a similar case arise, the biogas would be diverted to the external gas storage tank instead of being incinerated by the gas flare or released through pressure relief system.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When the leak was discovered, the valve at the start of the DN50 mm branch pipe was closed, immediately stopping the leak. The supply to the Olone unit returned to normal. An existing borehole, 30 m from the leak (bore n° 23), was put into operation in order to create an exhaust cone (flow = 900 m//h). The existing hydraulic barrier (network of 25 bore holes distributed around the chemicals plant creating a negative pressure of about 2 m aimed at preventing any downstream migration of pollution in the water table) was adapted so as to guarantee confinement of the pollution within the industrial site. At the end of August 2003, the situation on work undertaken was as follows:&amp;nbsp;- 55 observation wells (diameter 115 mm) were bored at the site to ascertain the extent of the pollution, pump the floating cyclohexane, vent gas and conduct analyses. This work required special precautions to be taken to prevent any risk of explosion when drilling;&amp;nbsp;- 2 bore holes to secure the cyclohexane were drilled with lowering of the water table (diameter 300 mm);&amp;nbsp;- 1 sparging barrier 300 m long was set up at the northern limit of the site to reinforce the existing hydraulic barrier (injection of air into the water table and recovery of gas by 18 doubled bore holes);&amp;nbsp;- 4 observation wells were drilled downstream of the site (in addition to the 3 existing);&amp;nbsp;- several hundred cyclohexane analyses were conducted in the observation wells (on site and downstream) by an external laboratory (detection limit 5 µg/l for a potability limit of 10 µg/l). This work enabled the extent of the pollution to be limited. At the end of August 2003 the spill extended beneath the industrial site over an area 600 m long and 300 m wide. The thickness of the floating cyclohexane varied from a few centimetres to a dozen centimetres. At the end of August 2003, 480 t of cyclohexane had been extracted from the subsoil (more than 90 % of it in floating form), by means of the 3 recovery systems in place: skimming the floating layer, venting and sparging. Investigations were conducted on biological treatment of the pollution using bacteria, specifically to denature cyclohexane, detected at the periphery of the polluted area. The authorities acted as follows: &amp;nbsp;- Monitoring and ascertaining the facts,&amp;nbsp;- conducting 5 inspections, on 8 January, 7 March, 13 June, 2 and 3 July 2003;&amp;nbsp;- proposing 2 emergency orders by the Prefect on 9 January 2003 (circumstances of the leak, pollution control, surveillance, feedback, information for the authorities) and 12 March 2003 (boosting pumping, downstream surveillance, independent expert assessment);&amp;nbsp;- organising 7 meetings with the operator (including 3 on information for the authorities);&amp;nbsp;- compiling several dozen reports, statements and letters to the Prefect and the operator as well as to elected representatives, environmental protection associations, the courts and media.A workgroup made up of the DRIRE, DDASS, DDAF and DIREN was specially formed to monitor and assess the consequences of the leak and suggest to the Prefect any necessary protective measures to be imposed relative to safety and public health. The workgroup concentrated mainly on:&amp;nbsp;- the operator checking the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier in place, so as to contain the pollution within the industrial site and prevent any downstream contamination;&amp;nbsp;- recovering the cyclohexane;- monitoring the water table downstream of the chemicals plant.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Various actions aimed at preventing a repetition of any such leak were implemented:1) On the cyclohexane branch pipe that leaked:&amp;nbsp;- installation of flow measurement on all cyclohexane lines with relaying to the Olone control room (materials report displayed with alarms), &amp;nbsp;- drafting of instructions in the event of non-use of the line (closure of the admission valve, draining down);&amp;nbsp;- annual inspection of the steam heating system;&amp;nbsp;- regular check on the condition of piping in the pipeway;&amp;nbsp;- assumption of a leak as soon as a fault is detected (information for staff + instructions).2) On the site's other pipework carrying dangerous fluids:&amp;nbsp;- procedure for allocating responsibilities between the different units on the site;&amp;nbsp;- 67 programmed modifications to dangerous fluid transfer lines;&amp;nbsp;- specification of methods of inspection and maintenance on operation of the steam heating system.A procedure for informing the authorities in the event of an incident was drafted jointly with the Prefecture. It has been tested since early 2003. This procedure includes in particular a rating of the incident established by means of a table covering the nature of the chemical (toxic, flammable, #), the size of the leak, the impact on the site and off the site. A separate rating assesses the potential impact on the basis of the volume of the system (potential leakage), the controllability of the event, the operability of safety systems, the potential impact on the site and off the site, quantifying damage and business interruption. The information is sent to national authorities (CODIS, Prefecture, Police, DRIRE, labour inspectorate, CRAM, emergency services) and to local authorities. The application of this procedure resulted in the company reporting 16 incidents between January and November 2003.The Chalampé chemicals plant has become the pilot site in the company's group for information for the authorities. The leak revealed:&amp;nbsp;- technical malfunctions: failure of the steam heating system, absence of information in real time (materials assessment) and alarm enabling the leak to be detected;&amp;nbsp;- the absence of inspection programmes covering the equipment involved (branch pipes, steam heating system, #) and the actual appointment of people responsible for the inspections;&amp;nbsp;- the absence of suitable instructions in the event of a leak;&amp;nbsp;- communication problems between the three departments involved;&amp;nbsp;- the presence of an unused, large dimension branch pipe without retention because the DN50 mm branch pipe admission valve is kept open;&amp;nbsp;- inappropriate reactions by operatives due to the aforementioned technical and organisational shortcomings and the absence of diagnostic support systems in the event of an alarm going off;&amp;nbsp;- incomplete information on the incident.The leak enabled:&amp;nbsp;- the effectiveness of the hydraulic barrier to be confirmed (set up in the nineteen eighties following pollution of communes' potable water sources due to the chemicals plant);&amp;nbsp;- action programmes to be upgraded and launched to prevent a further substantial leak;&amp;nbsp;- information to the authorities and adjoining communes to be rethought;&amp;nbsp;- the plant to be reminded of its duty of care and of the control of processes and the risks presented by its facilities;&amp;nbsp;- expertise and experience to be quickly assembled in the various departments tasked with public health, protection of the environment, the water authority and classified facilities authority through the workgroup.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Detection of the problemJust as for each process equipment with risks for major accidents, the phenomena which can lead to a degradation of the containment, in this case the storage tank, should be identified and analysed.This accident indicates the possible risks as a consequence of the presence of non mixable phases which can settle out. An investigation of the possible presence of such phases should form a part of the identification of possible corrosive phenomena. If necessary chemical analyses should be performed to determine the corrosive behaviour of these phases (chemical composition, pH,#).This incident further shows that in the bottom of storage tanks gutters can be formed. In those gutters corrosive products can accumulate, what can result in local, uniform corrosion. In the case water and/or other corrosive products can induce corrosion of the tank bottom, it should be investigated if there is also a problem of gutter forming in the bottom.Gutter forming in the bottom of storage tanks is induced by a combination of the size of the storage tank, the local compressibility of the foundation and a relative elastic underground. The gutters are not always visible by the eye. They can be mapped by performing a topographic investigation. The topographic maps are achieved by a surveyor who measures the bottom of the storage tank with a laser.The local uniform corrosion which is a consequence of the gutter forming is not easily detected. The local reduction of the thickness of the bottom plate can be overlooked if ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed on a cross banded pattern. If the risk of local corrosion due to gutter forming in the bottom exists, suitable techniques should be used to investigate the bottom plates. These techniques are described below.6.2. Possible solutionsIf local, uniform corrosion induced by gutter forming is a problem, the company should take suitable measures to avoid a loss of containment as a consequence of the corrosion. In the next paragraph some different possible measures are listed according to the place they take in the prevention hierarchy. In function of the specific situation it can be necessary to take multiple measures, if necessary completed with additional measures which are not described here.1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Avoiding or limiting the presence of corrosive products that can settle out.2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Avoid that products settle out (mixing the different phases)Mixing of the products in the storage tank can avoid or limit that insoluble phases settle out. To achieve good results the effectiveness of the mixing is important.3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Removing of settled out productsIt has to be assured by a procedure that settled out products are periodically removed. But note that the draining of settled out products does not guarantee that settlements are removed out of gutters in the bottom.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Avoiding the formation of gutters in the bottomExisting storage tanks can be lifted up and the foundation underneath can be restored. In this case it must be kept in mind that by performing a hydrostatic test it is possible that new settlements can take place. For existing tanks there is also the possibility to analyse the foundation and the underground under the storage tanks in order to gather enough information to perform calculations. These calculations can indicate if the risk of gutter forming exists or not. For new storage tanks a detailed calculations of the foundations can be performed during the design phase to reduce the risk of gutter formation.5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; LiningA lining is applied on the tank bottom and the first shell course. A lining which is well attached will largely reduce the corrosion velocity. A badly adjusted lining will still reduce the uniform corrosion but will promote pitting corrosion underneath the lining. A good attachment of a lining depends on a lot of parameters such as moisture, temperature, kind of lining, not stepping on a not fully hardened layer,#.&amp;nbsp; To achieve guarantee about the thickness of the lining and the attachment of the lining it is necessary to perform measurements on the thickness of the different layers, to perform a conductivity test and to perform a non porosity test. The code API 652 "Linings of aboveground petroleum storage tank bottoms" describes the advantages and disadvantages of different kind of linings.6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Planning of internal inspections based on the corrosion velocityThe intervals between internal inspections have to be defined based on the estimated corrosion velocity. This is a general principle that can be found in de API 653 standard "Tank Inspection, Repair, Alteration and Reconstruction". Normally the corrosion velocity of the bottom plates is the most important one. In the case of major local corrosion, it will be this higher, local corrosion velocity which is determinative for the inspection interval.The internal corrosion velocity can be determined by analysing the settled out products. Based on graphics which indicate the overall corrosion velocity of the construction material as a function of the corrosive character of these residues (e.g. pH-measurement), the corrosion velocity can be estimated. Based on the corrosion velocity it can be determined how long the storage tank can be safely used before a next internal inspection is necessary. API 653 describes what minimum plate thicknesses have to be measured to use a storage tank safely. If it is expected that large differences can occur in the chemical composition and the properties of the residues, these analyses and the calculation of the inspection interval must be periodically repeated. The analysis of the bottom products can be used to trace other corrosion phenomena (e.g. bacteriological corrosion).&amp;nbsp; 7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Adapted internal inspection techniquesInternal inspections in which case ultrasonic thickness measurements are only performed in a cross banded pattern (just to achieve a general impression of the thickness of the bottom of the storage tank) are not sufficient to trace local, uniform corrosion.In order to achieve an entire image of all changes in the thickness of the bottom of a storage tank the bottom must be totally scanned. Floor scans are very useful to measure sudden volume changes in the floor (e.g. pitting corrosion). They can however also be used to trace gradual changes in the thickness of the bottom plates. To guarantee that a floor scan generates accurate information on the state of the entire bottom of the storage tank, certain conditions have to be satisfied.It must be checked if the presence of a lining has an influence on the results of the floor scan.Before the inspection is must be clearly discussed with the performers in which state the storage tank must be presented to achieve good measurements. In some cases the entire bottom of the storage tank must be sand blasted before measurements can be performed. In this case it is necessary to discuss the criteria for the sand blasting in advance. It is also favourable that the contractor who will perform the floor scan inspects the cleaning conditions of the bottom plates.The signal that is generated by the floor scanning apparatus can suffer from drift. This phenomenon is not necessarily a problem if the floor scanning is used to detect pitting corrosion. The moment pitting corrosion is detected, the signal changes so much that even with some drift on the signal, the pitting corrosion is detected. The drift on the electric signal has however a much larger impact when floor scanning is used to detect gradual changes in the bottom floor. To solve this problem it is useful to perform a few ultrasonic thickness measurements on each bottom plate. The signal from the floor scanning apparatus can be gauged for each bottom plate in order to achieve accurate measurements on gradual changes in the bottom thickness.8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Additional external inspection techniquesIn addition to the above described internal inspections, intermediate external inspections can be performed in order to gather additional information on the corrosion status of the storage tanks. These inspection techniques, which can be applied when the storage tanks are in duty, are especially useful when there is large uncertainty on the corrosion phenomena and/or on the corrosion velocity.A first technique uses acoustic emission measurements. Microphones are placed on the shell of the storage tank to receive sound waves coming out of the tank. Each sound wave is stored and the source of the noise is calculated by software. The sounds that can be associated with a general corrosion activity have a very high frequency. The data are processed in order to map the places where corrosion activity is found and to determine the density of the corrosion activity. The technique makes it also possible to determine different grades of corrosion activity, going from grade A (very small) to grade E(high corrosion activity). As a function of the established corrosion activity it can be decided to perform immediately an internal inspection on the storage tank (in case of grade E), to reschedule the next internal inspection to an earlier date or to repeat the acoustic emission measurements after a certain period.The acoustic emission technique also allows to detect leaks. These leaks are detected at other frequencies than the frequencies at which the general corrosion activity is detected. This technique makes it possible to detect small perforations in the tank bottom.Another technique to achieve an indication of certain corrosion phenomena is "long range ultrasonics". This technique admits to achieve a qualitative image of the status of the annular bottom plates (not from the entire tank bottom) by using guided waves.These external inspection techniques do not gather (quantitative) information about the corrosion velocity and can't be used to enlarge the inspection interval that is based on the corrosion velocity.9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Applying leak detection techniquesSeveral techniques can be applied to detect a leak in the bottom of a storage tank while the storage tank is in duty.A possible leak detection technique exists of cables placed in the underground at fixed distances. The conductivity of these cables changes if a product is detected in the underground.Larger leaks can be detected by looking for abnormal deviations in the fluid level in the storage tank. If a continuous level measurement is installed on the storage tank, it is possible to install an extra alarm in the control program. The alarm is generated when the fluid level decreases when there are no pumping activities out of the storage tank. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

An independent board for accident investigation is being formed to investigate the cause of the accident (they also take into account: legislation, governmental services, permits, regulatory bodies, emergency measures taken, audits, procedures etc.). Decontamination (asbestos, personal safety equipment). The municipality provided psychological help, financial support and new housing for the people.Emergency measures - Remarks: Around 15.00 reports of fire near the Grolsch brewery reached the police. At 15.03 the police arrived at the site, fire brigade followed at 15.08 and the first ambulance arrived at 15.16. By now a large crowd of spectators was assembling, attracted by the spectacle of the exploding fireworks. Police and ambulance personnel decided to keep the public at distance and, with some difficulty, managed to clear the Tollensstraat. Shortly afterwards, at 15.36 the final explosion took place. The fire brigade suffered heavy losses: 4 fire men were missing, several more were injured and all of their equipment was destroyed. As a result hardly any attempts to extinguish the fires were made during the first 40 minutes after the explosions. The many small fires in the area developed into an sea of fire. During the next hours contingency plans were set into action. Fire brigades and medical assistance were called in from other parts of the country and Germany. The last fires were put out on May 15, 02.00. Emergency facilities for the treatment of wounded and shelters for people who lost their houses were organised. The search and registration for missing persons was organised. Arrangements have been made to compensate the victims for their material losses. Psychological follow-up care is still being provided.Seveso II duties  - remarks: 
Written safety
regulations had been made available to all employees. These included a
smoking prohibition, regulations for wearing cotton clothing,
regulations for handling boxes of firework during loading and
unloading, check on the use of personal protection devices and the use
of fire extinguishers. Nearly all employees had followed specific
training for working with fireworks.
Official action taken - legal action: Public prosecution started a penal investigation.Official action taken - other official action: A special committee (Committee Oosting) has been installed to investigate the disaster. The committee presented its report on February 28, 2001.Assisted by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports (VWS) a Centre for Information and Advice (Informatie- en Adviescentrum) was set up shortly after the disaster, and measures have been taken concerning medical and psycho-social after-care. The Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and Environment (VROM) was involved in soil decontamination, demolition of buildings and removal of asbestosThe Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (SZW) was involved in three financial emergency arrangements in the week after the disaster for occupants involved.The government gave an advance to the city Enschede to cover additional expenses. Also, funds have been added to the budgets of several departments (total amount DFL 92,1 million).Eight state inspections have conducted an investigation, final reports were presented on January 15, 2001.Four state inspections have conducted an investigation into the follow-up of the fireworks explosion in Culemborg in 1991. These reports were presented on February 19, 2001.In the third week of June, all mayors involved were informed of locations of munitions depots by the Ministry of Defence in consultation with VROM.On June 26, 2000, the Court of Mayor and Aldermen of Enschede have installed the Committee Financial Settlements (Commissie Financiële Afwikkeling). Arrangements for private persons and companies were presented in September and November 2000. VROM took the initiative to construct a directive on fireworks. The concept directive was published on February 26, 2001.On July 27, 2000 VROM presented an inventory of fireworks companies in The Netherlands Between July and October 2000, the external safety of munitions depots was inventoried by the Environmental Hygiene Inspection </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Next to the shortcomings of the company itself, the Committee Oosting reported a series of shortcomings in the government. These include not giving appropriate attention to the matter of external safety (at least where professional fireworks are concerned), not following up on lessons learned from an earlier fireworks explosion (Culemborg, 1991), inaccessibility of regulations and information on the subject, lack of communication between the official organisation and the politically responsible administrators and lack of supervision and enforcement. These issues have received a lot of political attention. Measures are planned concerning:-investigation into the disaster-state actions after the disaster-regulations on fireworks (both existing regulations and a new directive)-the permit policy -the external safety policyMeasures to mitigate consequences: Measures concerning (for details see references): -incorporating experiences in relevant documents (e.g. the National Handbook Crisis Decision Making (nationaal handboek crisisbesluitvorming))-the quality and supervision of preparing for disasters-intensifying the multi-disciplinary approach in disaster preparation-the co-ordination of combatting disasters and the National Support Facility Disaster Combatment (Landelijke Ondersteuningsfaciliteit Rampenbestrijding)-emergency rooms, communication and information provision-protection of environment and health|· information and advice centre (Informatie- en Adviescentrum)-psycho-social and medical after-care -financial arrangements-municipality disaster combat plans-co-ordination of investigations into disaster combatUseful References: Report of the Committee Investigation Fireworks Disaster ('Committee Oosting'), February 28, 2001; MAHB, Workshop on Pyrotechnic and Explosive Substances, March 28-29; Cabinet Standpoint Fireworks Disaster, March 23, 2001</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Air testing was carried out by the volunteer fire brigade after the incident, and no adverse effects could be detected. The public was warned by radio, and windows and doors in the surrounding area were closed.
The contaminated areas were assessed by the insurer’s experts and there were direct reports of damage by those affected. The insurance will cover the clean-up costs and deal with the external damage that occurred.
It has not yet been possible to identify any specific surface contamination, but this is very likely to be detectable on roof tops. What measures will need to be taken cannot yet be determined.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Expert recommendations:

Clear labelling of the reactor vessel tanks.
Harmonisation of the labelling on site with the production specifications, the batch protocols and the process control system (PCS); harmonisation with other plant documentation.
Training workers to apply the ‘second pair of eyes’ principle; differentiation between critical dosages/additions (checked by the shift supervisor in accordance with the ‘second pair of eyes’ principle) and less critical dosages/additions (checked by two shift workers in accordance with the ‘second pair of eyes’ principle), with documentation of this by the plant manager/production manager in the production specifications/batch protocols.
Bolting shut any unused manholes/handholes on the tanks.
Dispensing is to stop automatically if it is not confirmed by a worker that the reaction has started.
Setting out the criteria in the production specifications/batch protocols for determining whether the reaction has started.
As with the reactor vessel, the start of the reaction should be shown in the PCS.
Assessing the accumulation of pressure during the course of the reaction in order to ensure that the rupture discs are of a sufficient size (maximum accumulation of 15%); reviewing existing procedures; for new procedures before the Research &amp;amp; Development Department starts production.
In the short term, implementing an automatic trigger for the addition of an inhibitor.
Modifying the catch tank.
Installing a cyclone separator downstream of the catch tank.
Reviewing and evaluating the catch tank with a view to optimisation; implementing any necessary improvements.
Reviewing and revising the production specifications and the batch protocols.Risk analyses (HAZOP) for defined reference procedures to define requirements for process control technology and safety-oriented controls.
Drafting and implementing instructions for identification of key safety data for new procedures by the Research &amp;amp; Development Department before production starts, as well as determining the responsibilities and other content.
Risk analyses should be carried out before new production procedures become operational in the production process; instructions setting out actions and responsibilities should be drawn up and implemented.
As part of the HAZOP studies and the revision of the explosion protection document, the issue of “adding a solid to a container of flammable liquid” should be considered and safeguards should be put in place. These should also be implemented for existing procedures. The explosion protection document should be revised.

Additional measures taken by the operator:

&amp;nbsp;Safety data sheets are stored on the intranet.
A brief overview of safety data sheets for new raw materials is provided in the Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) / Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) software.
The tasks of the shift supervisors are being redefined.

Optimisation of the catch tank with regard to separation of the liquid/gaseous phases.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">More than 20 on-site refinery fire crew attended the incident. Off-site emergency services also attended but were not physically involved in fire fighting.
&amp;nbsp;
The emergency response to the incident highlighted issues regarding compliance with the evacuation procedures by both employees and contractors.&amp;nbsp; Although all personnel were evacuated from site, the evacuation procedure, as written in the Coryton Incident Management plan, requires that on hearing the site major incident alarm, personnel should go to their local designated building, and to the assembly point therein.&amp;nbsp; After the alarm sounded on the day of the incident approximately 220 contractors ignored this and logged out of site leaving via the main security gate.&amp;nbsp; A small number of Petroplus employees also left site in this way. When a Petroplus employee was despatched to effect a head count, the contractors were subsequently found to have assembled in the contractor village on the West site. During their induction to site contractors are told that in the event of a major incident alarm they should go to their nearest designated building, and are provided with a book showing the locations of the designated buildings.
&amp;nbsp;
The audibility of alarms at certain locations was poor which meant that it took some time before all personnel were informed of the hazard present on the plant.
&amp;nbsp;
There was no record made, prior to the response, of the members of the site emergency crew.&amp;nbsp; This would normally be done using a tag board located on the fire appliance in use.&amp;nbsp; However, at the time of the incident the usual fire appliance that carries a tag board was out of service and the replacement appliance used did not carry a tag board.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As part of the reinstatement process and continued operations at the refinery, the Competent Authority required the operator to demonstrate that&amp;nbsp;"on-refinery on-plot pipework had been assessed for the potential of corrosion under insulation (CUI)"; and&amp;nbsp;"that steps taken to ensure that the occurrence of CUI affecting integrity of refinery on-plot pipework be reliably identified and that any necessary repairs undertaken".&amp;nbsp;

All on plot pipework meeting the conditions for most likelihood of failure from CUI (insulated and operating between minus 10oc and plus 150oc) and also with the most consequence of failure (Class 1 and 2 pipes, as per API 570) was targeted for inspection.&amp;nbsp; This pipework was identified from the Process Flow Diagrams (PFDs) and two teams each consisting of a Mechanical Engineer, Production Operator, and an Inspection Engineer walked the lines looking for areas of concern e.g. water ingress points, damaged cladding, cladding obstructions, and visual symptoms such as rust staining or bulging of the cladding.&amp;nbsp; This approach identified approximately 250 locations for insulation removal which was completed, together with pipework inspections and any resulting remedial work, before the unit was reinstated.&amp;nbsp; Four incidents of CUI were identified, where the wall loss in the localised area had exceeded the corrosion allowance of the line.&amp;nbsp; Repairs are scheduled to either replace or install temporary repair clamps.
&amp;nbsp;
Petroplus finalised a formal inspection and management regime for CUI: ‘Equipment Maintenance Strategy EMS-MECH 36: Insulated Piping – Corrosion Under Insulation (CUI) Management’ and developed an action plan for its implementation across the refinery. 
&amp;nbsp;
Improvements are required on the evacuation procedures, roll-call arrangements and audibility of alarms. Inconsistencies between the Incident Management Plan and the Emergency Response Procedure need to be resolved. 
Petroplus have&amp;nbsp;reviewed&amp;nbsp;their procedures and&amp;nbsp;actions&amp;nbsp;will be monitored.&amp;nbsp;</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Although most of the water used in fire fighting operations had been contained within the tanks dikes (after the interception of the sewer network and by means of dedicated pumps), a certain part of it flowed into the nearby Lavello channel and then in the Tirreneam sea.EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The degree of pollution of the air, soil and water due to the release of toxic substances and combustion products as well as the fire extinguishing water were continuously controlled (the results of these checks are shown in a document attached to the Original Report).Blood samples had been taken from people directly involved in the accident (FARMOPLANT personnel and fire fighters), but the analysis did not detected anything abnormal (code 7701).  People was warned to careful wash fruits and vegetables before to eat them and to follow the normal rules of personal hygiene (code 7503). No emergency measures are still required, neither on-site nor off-site (code 7703).  When the Original Report was prepared (27/08/1988) the type of danger was still present because traces of Rogor have been found in some samples taken in the discharge water from FARMOPLANT and in the Lavello torrent. Besides the danger of water contamination in case of persistent rain existed. No data are available about the actual situation.Official action taken - other official action: After the accident, on July 18 the Environment Minister emitted an ordinance to stop the installation activities for a period of 6 months to carry out the necessary controls and define the plant safety level needed to prevent similar accidents. The same day, the Mayor of Massa emitted an ordinance to stop the installation activities (except the operations necessary for a safety shut-down of the plant). When the Original Report was prepared the production plants were still stopped and only an incineration plant for production residues and a biological treatment plant of liquid effluents were operating.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

At the beginning, the firefighters used water to wash the tank to wipe out the leaked liquid chlorine. Later, the emergency command headquarters adopted environmental protection departments' suggestions and changed their approach to use caustic soda to deal with the leaked liquid chlorine. It immediately conveyed about 200t caustic soda to the accident site to treat the leaked liquid chlorine to control the expansion of the pollution. Faced with the situation that liquid was leaking and pollution was expanding, the emergency command headquarters organized rescue workers to build dams and levees in nearby rivers and to dig a large pool nearby in accordance with the environmental protection departments' suggestions. Then, rescue workers used a crane to lift the liquid chlorine tank into the pool and used caustic soda to neutralize the remaining liquid chlorine in the tank. As a result, the pollution was further controlled.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

The intervention of automatic isolation valves on the reactor were not fast enough to prevent more unused ethylene entering the reactor and therefore to feed the aerial explosion. Automatic dump valves on the feeding line operated 2 seconds to dump residual ethylene to atmosphere resulting also in feeding the aerial explosion.No off-site emergency measures were necessary (code 7703).

1- to use new smart sensors to speed up the reactor isolation and, therefore, to reduce the amount of gas released;
2- to vent ethylene to a separate, contained system or increase considerably the delay before the automatic dumping of the lines contents.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">After the event, the filling station was closed by the supervisory authority. Around 200 m³ of the substrate in question were still stored there. Ways of disposing of it safely were examined.Oxygen (through an air separation plant, 95% purity) was introduced into the pressure chamber of the filling station to continue biological desulfurization. The existing gas was burned off using a special flare. During combustion, the remaining substrate was stirred.The flare was operated until H2S could no longer be measured in the crude gas.
A risk analysis was carried out by an external engineering firm for the filling and unloading of the filling station and an operating instruction was drawn up. A safety distance was set during the filling process, which was monitored metrologically. Filling was carried out with at least two persons. Despite safety precautions, a further accident occurred with one injured person (short-term loss of consciousness) during the third filling process. In the cab of the towing vehicle, H2S gas was drawn into the foot well and entered the driver’s cab through the cab ventilation system, which was running.Escape was not possible as the windows of the driver’s cab were closed. In terms of metrology, only the filling area was initially monitored. When the door was opened, the gas flowed towards the driver and led to a short period of unconsciousness. The other person supervising immediately alerted rescuers.Before it was spread, the remaining substrate was first examined from the point of view of soil compatibility. The analysis showed that from the point of view of soil chemistry, there was no obstacle to it being applied to fields. In agreement with the Agricultural Office, the application was carried out by means of injection technology in remote fields.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The relevant substrate thickening process is no longer used at the site. A different process from another manufacturer is used.Accessible platforms with railings were installed at the filling stations. This avoids the need to climb on the tanker. In addition, a mirror has been installed on the outlet pipe so that the fill level of the tank can be ascertained from the ground.Each tanker must register and then de-register after a specified period of time.Otherwise, an alarm will be triggered in the control room. The alarm is directed to the mobile phone of the members of staff on duty.The entire filling area is under video surveillance.
Findings from the Baden-Württemberg State Office for the Environment:

Risks from hydrogen sulfide formation can also arise under certain conditions in biogas plants using only renewable raw materials and where additional processing facilities, such as digestate thickening plants, are operated.
The operator is responsible for safety throughout the operational area.&amp;nbsp;They must ensure that extensions and additions to the plant originally operated are checked for safety and that dangerous interactions are avoided. To this end, a systematic hazard analysis should be used.
The systematic hazard analysis must also cover trial operation.&amp;nbsp;Defects and deviations from biological and chemical process parameters must be taken into account.
The safety management system must cover changes to the installation and the activities of third parties (e.g. suppliers / plant manufacturers). This includes requirements to document trial operation and regular review and assessment of the documentation.

The on-site emergency service, alerted by automatic fire warning devices (rate-of-rise heat detector and a flame warning device), arrived at the accident site at 17.06, and fire fighting operations were started Soon (at ca. 17.15) a trailer with 250 kg of extinguishing chemical powder was added to the equipment being used, in order to make a more effective extinguishing effect.
The installation's technical manager, who was present when the accident occurred, shut off the hydrogen supply from the storage tanks at ca.17.06 by closing the shutoff valves.
By 17.44 the fire had been extinguished and the alert state could be terminated.
The professional fire department and the Minden Municipal Voluntary Fire Department were alerted as a precautionary measure; there was however no necessity for their active intervention in the fire fighting operations.

2. A second main gas pipeline which was already partly installed between the digesters and the gas holder entrance shaft to increase plant capacity was completed and it now serves as a bypass to the existing gas system.
3. A more hydraulically powerful bottom outlet (DN 100) was fitted to the existing main gas pipeline. This will enable foam and digestate that have entered the gas system to be removed much faster in an emergency.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The reconstruction of the kiln hood also included structural changes ensuring that no unincinerated explosive material can accumulate in the technically unavoidable annular gap between the rotary cylinder and the hood. This eliminates the cause established in an expert report, i.e. the accumulation of explosive material in the discharge hopper at the kiln hood. Consequently it is not possible for such damage to the plant to occur again.
The new design provides for a plug inserted approx. 250 mm into the front rotary cylinder. The gap between the rotary cylinder and the plug is only approx. 20 mm wide.
The high temperatures in the combustion zone in the rotary cylinder ahead of the plug and the small gap will almost certainly prevent unincinerated material from passing through the gap and entering the discharge hopper area at the kiln hood. In addition, the gap at the hood discharge hopper is reduced from 250 mm to approx. 50 mm.
Additional organisational measures will ensure that no material can accumulate in the hood discharge hopper. Control and cleaning cycles will be laid down to match the material being handled. The volume of material discharged will be monitored and the discharged substances checked for unconverted waste and explosive material.
To monitor the condition of the rotary cylinder as regards wear and deposits during plant operation, the new kiln hood design provides for suitable means of inspection. This ensures that the condition of the rotary cylinder is checked regularly.
The risk assessment for the necessary checks and the procedure for emptying the discharge hopper have been adjusted accordingly. The damage was mainly confined to the secured, physically separate kiln area. In future this will continue to be secured by means of technical and organisational safety measures such as a ban on entering the kiln room when discharging waste, defined safety times on completion of waste discharge and securing the kiln room with light barriers to switch off kiln feeding.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">When the accident occurred the operator was dismantling the safety relief valve to be calibrated. When he noticed the release of LPG he immediately alerted the storage house manager who activated the procedures foreseen by the onsite emergency plan (securing the installation by activating the shut-off valves on the pipes and the tanks constituting the tank park and starting the transfer of the LPG from the leaking tank into another partially empty tank).After a call from the company and also from the neighbouring population, first the fire brigade of Bassano del Grappa and then the fire brigade of Vicenza intervened and stopped the leak by sealing the valve seat of the safety relief valve which had been ejected by means of a threaded blind plug.For safety reasons the traffic on the road passing near the establishment (express way SS248 Gasparona was closed) throughout the occurrence (from approximately 11:25 hrs to 15:00 hrs).Official action taken - legal action: Immediately after the accident the Attorney General of Bassano del Grappa ordered the sealing off of tank no. 1 and equipment involved in the accident. The competent judicial authorities started criminal proceedings which were concluded in June 2002.Official action taken - other official action: The Regional Technical Committee  (CTR ) discussed the technical report presented by the fire brigade commander of Vicenza taking note of the accident causes, which successively led the company to present a new safety report.Seveso II duties  - remarks: When the accident occurred a
complete safety management system had not been implemented. Only after
the accident was the Safety Management System completely implemented
and verified with an inspection in February 2002.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Immediate lessons: Considering the
results of the technical investigation performed by the fire brigade on
the safety valve assembly, the company decided to substitute the valve
assembly concerned in the accident and all the other similar valve
assemblies on the other 6 tanks.
The competent inspection authority (ISPESL) also imposed the
installation on the pipe connecting the valve assembly and the tank, of
an additional shut-off ball valve with a seal applied on the all-open
position.
This measure was agreed upon with the competent regional control
authority. Measures to prevent recurrence: All safety valve assemblies were substituted and between each assembly and tank an additional valve with seal was installed, as described before, in order to be able to shut-off possible accidental releases. Measures to mitigate consequences: As a containment measure for accidental releases the installation of a water barrier is foreseen around LPG tanks.Useful references: The study of the accident was presented at the 2002 Risk Evaluation and Management Conference (VCR 2002) held in Pisa, with the title "Analisi di un incidente - Rilascio di GPL gas" by the authors F.

The peak of fluorine pollution was 15 mg/l in the Tauran and 0.97 mg/l at 02:00 on 25 August in the Robine (the threshold of potability is 1.5 mg/l). A low level of fish mortality was noted on 25 and 26 August. No change in pollutant content was revealed by the piezometers installed in the proximity of the Tauran. The level of the discharge fell back below the thresholds after 4 days.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

Description of the situation prior to the accident:1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 8.1.2006 - technology shutdown of HCN and cyanide production. At the time the AKH production was not in operation, DPG production was in normal operation as was the pumping of wastewater from the hydraulic barrier. 2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Only wastewater from the DPG and hydraulic barrier was lead to the WWTP - detoxication sump. In order to clean the equipment on 8.1.2006 the cyanide production equipment remained shutdown. Once the WWTP (chemical) container was filled, the wastewater was pumped to the WWTP - detoxication sump for further treatment. Monitoring of the detoxication sump is done both by a floating gauge that signals that the sump is full and by visual inspection by service staff. 3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The night shift 8/9.1.2006 - according to the staff working on the night shift no variation from the normal operation was noted after shutting down the HCN and cyanide production. During the night the temperature dropped from approx. 13°C to -15°C. Due to the fact that water leaking during shutdown of production is much more concentrated, pretreatment was performed on detoxication sump 3 which was unsuccessful. A responsible staff member was made aware of this by telephone at approx 11 o'clock pm. He decided to fill the sump and that treatment would be performed on the morning shift. In the second half of the shift no employees were working in the vicinity of the sumps neither were the sumps visually inspected. Employees left the plant at 6 o'clock am.2. Temporal course of the accident in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump at LZD and subsequent action taken:1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 9.1.2006 the detoxication sump WWTP was found to be completely full in the early hours; a responsible employee determined that there was no overflow from the sump. Responsible employee who filled the sump took these immediate measures:-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; In conformity with the working instruction PI 1201-16-02; point 5.1 (deviation from the normal technological regime) a submerged pump was used to pump the content of sump 3 (full sump) to sump 2 to reduce its volume.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The equipment was checked to determine why there was no signal that the sump was full. It was determined that the floating signal gauge was frozen (due to the low temperatures during the night). The indicator of the gauge was freed manually and the gauge immediately began to operate with no problem.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The concentration of the discharged water was checked and found not to exceed the limit values.After taking these measures he checked the other parts of the WWTP and chemical WWTP. On his return he realized that the pump hose was pulled out of the side of the sump. On first inspection no water was flowing from the hose and nothing indicated that any water had escaped from the sump. Therefore he did not evaluate the situation at this time as an accident and did not report anything to his superiors. This information only came to light in his statement dated 10.2.2006.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 12.1.2006 (in the early hours) - service staff at the Podebrady and Nymburk dams informed the water management control center of the Labe river catchment authorities of considerable fish fatalities near the hydraulic power station. The police, CIZP, and the local fishery unions in Podebrady and Nymburk were informed immediately. Analysis of the dead fish determined an accidental degradation of water quality caused by an unknown material, which was subsequently determined to be total cyanide.3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 13.1.2006 (Friday) - CIZP performed an inspection at LZD in order to determine the possibility of a release of cyanide. After a local investigation they determined that the presence of cyanide in the Labe could have originated at LZD. The CIZP hypothesis stated that most probably an overflow of the detoxication sump occurred and water was released through the company's sewerage system to the Labe.&amp;nbsp; 4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1.2006 (Monday) - an internal committee was set up to determine:·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Whether or not the ecological accident was caused by contaminated water from LZD·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The actual cause of the accident·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The temporal course of the accident·&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Effective remedial measures4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1.2006 - technical equipment was inspected at the WWTP - detoxication sump to determine the possible cause of the accident. From the first information given by staff on the morning shift it was determined that during the change of shifts on 9.1. detoxication sump 3 was found to be completely full whereby they pumped part of the contents and that they subsequently found the signal gauge to be frozen and fixed this problem. There was no mention at this stage that the pump hose was found beside the sump. Based on this information the floating signal gauge was checked and was taken into consideration during the investigation of the occurrence and causes of the accident, and relevant remedial measures were taken i.e. increase in frequency of physical inspection in the area of discharge of wastewater from LZD.&amp;nbsp; 5. 16.1.2006 - CIZP performed another inspection where further details of the accident came to light including the measures taken to avoid a repeat of the accident. 6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1.2006 - considering the local investigation performed together with CIZP and the information given by staff of the morning shift the Commission stated that on the 9.1.2006 there was most probably an accident at LZD involving a release of an undefined volume of discharge water to the Labe. 7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 16.1-17.12006 - based on point 6 remediation of the surroundings of the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed including measures to limit release to the sewerage system. 8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD presented its statement at a press conference that based on internal investigation and the conclusion of CIZP an accident occurred on 9.1.2006 which led to the release of wastewater with an undefined content of cyanide to the Labe.9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 17.1.2006 - LZD announced a major accident pursuant to Article 15 paragraph 2 of Act 353/1999 Coll. to the relevant state administration within the legal deadline (i.e. within 24 hours of determining an accident occurred).10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 19.1.2006 - first negotiations between LZD and the local fishery unions on compensation for damages caused by the accident.11.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 20.1.2006 - a report was submitted to CIZP on remedial measures to be taken and their deadlines for elaboration. 12.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 23.1.2006 - internal guidelines (organization regulations) were issued at LZD to improve controls and record keeping of the discharge of wastewater and to establish further measures to be taken to solve issues of wastewater discharge at LZD.13.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;24.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. was commissioned to elaborate an expert opinion on the situation and the possible causes of the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.14.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 26.1.2006 - Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. submits his expert opinion to LZD.15.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 27.1.2006 - CIZP issued a report on the fulfillment of remedial measures set by CIZP.16.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;27.1.2006 - CIZP issued with the expert opinion on the malfunction of the floating signalization gauge.17.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 27.1.2006 - meeting between LZD and the Labe River Catchment Authority at which the accident was reviewed and proposals for further steps to be taken and cooperation between the two bodies were made.18.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 31.1.2006 - LZD and the fisheries sign an agreement of financial compensation for losses caused by the accident.19.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 27.1.2006 - 16.2.2006 - based on the conclusions of Doc. Ing. Jan Chysky CSc. and the information on total cyanide contamination in the river (taken from Labe River Catchment Authority reports) it was determined that the malfunction of the gauge could not be the only cause of the accident. For this reason and based on further investigation, the internal Committee came to the conclusion that human error was to some extent involved in the accident.20.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 10.2.2006 - internal investigation with staff members of energy production and in particular those who were preset on the night and morning shifts prior to and during the accident. This resulted in the opinions of individual employees on the course of the shifts prior to and during the accident. In particular Mr. Charamzy (WWTP - sump service staff member), Mr. Krutsky (WWTP - sump supervisor) and Mr. Soukup (head of energy production). 21.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 17.2.2006 - on the basis of the results of the internal investigation the general manager was informed of the possible causes of the accident by an internal memo which stated that several human errors occurred during the accident, including:-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not correctly evaluate the state of the detoxication sumps during the night shift or organize the activity of the service staff,-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor acted carelessly during pumping of the detoxication sump,-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor poorly evaluated the situation&amp;nbsp; from the point of view of the possible release of toxic water and accident occurrence and did not inform his subordinates,-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The WWTP sump specialist - supervisor did not divulge all of the facts important in determining the causes of the accident during the first internal investigation.22.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 21.2.2006 - LZD informed the public at a press conference that based on the internal investigation it was determined that other than the technical malfunction, human error was also to blame for the accident.3. Remedial measures taken after discovery of accident:The following measures were taken at LZD after the accident of 9.1.2006 (adopted in cooperation with CIZP):Immediate measures taken after determining the accident:-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The rainwater sewerage system was shut down in the area of the WWTP - detoxication sump and the sewerage system was temporarily insulated with a VAPO pneumatic filling. When the climatic conditions improve the outlet will be concreted. Concreting was performed in the second half of 2006.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Signalization system was improved with doubling the amount of floating signalization gauges-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Physical checks of the working of the floating signalization gauges at the beginning of each shift change were initiated.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Expert opinion on the analysis of the state of the signalization gauge in sump 3 was commissioned with emphasis on the possible technical malfunction on 9.1.2006.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Frequency of visual checks on filling of detoxication sumps increased to once per hour at least for each sump.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Above-ground supply pipes were checked for integrity of joints.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Pump hoses were changed and an overall inspection of pumps used in the WWTP - detoxication sump was performed.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Frequency of analyses of discharged wastewater from LZD outlets increased, specifically for presence of cyanide min. once every 2 hours on specific objects. -&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The system for control and recording of wastewater discharge from the detoxication sumps was changed. New internal guideline OP VR 13 - 06 - "control of discharged wastewater from the detoxication sump WWTP" was elaborated, which sets the scope and method of record keeping of wastewater discharge, in particular it sets the responsibility for responsible people to give signed permission for the discharge of the sumps.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Training and testing of all service staff of the detoxication sumps on their knowledge of internal technological guidelines related to their employment was performed.The following measures were not taken immediately or could not be taken immediately:-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Rapid construction of new chemical-biological WWTP with deadline to be in pilot operation 31.10.2006 at the latest.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Evaluation of the current capacity of the WWTP - detoxication sumps-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Issuing of internal memo to inform all employees of set limits for wastewater discharge from LZD for CN- tox and CN- total.-&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Directive of the general manager issued at the managerial meeting 23.1.2006, "During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation".In order to fulfill the long-term and short-term measures the following tasks were accepted in the minutes from operational meeting no. 4 dated 23.1.2006:- &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; verify production technology in areas where a release of hazardous compounds to the environment may occur and up-date or change documentation in order to reduce the volume o hazardous compounds and the risk of release &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Deadline for fulfillment of task: 30.6.2006&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Completion: task is completed, responsible person ing.

These will be made known when complete by responsible members of the management without delay. The results of the administrative procedures will be made known to the employees in the local press. - During non-standard behavior of technology or disposal of waste of any type limit or completely stop production and together with relevant responsible person determine the situation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Deadline for completing task:&amp;nbsp; constantCompletion of task: task fulfilled constantly, the relevant employees are fully informed.4. Evaluation of the actions of LZD employees during the accident, verification of operative processes of employees and their compliance with the law and LZD internal guidelines:Description of the WWTP - detoxication sumpWastewater from the production of AKH and DPG are lead to the detoxication sump from the hydraulic barrier and wastewater with a high content of CN ions for rinsing of cyanide production equipment. Under normal operational conditions the following average daily volumes are lead to the WWTP - detoxication sumps:from DPG production &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 100 - 120 m3from AKH production and HCN&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 30 - 35&amp;nbsp; m3from Hydraulic barrier&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 10 - 15&amp;nbsp; m3Wastewater from the production of HCN and NaCN are lead to the chemical WWTP, which treats water with high content of CN ions. Toxic water in the WWTP-detoxication sump usually has toxic levels ranging in the hundreds of mg CN-/l.The total capacity of the detoxication sumps under normal operational conditions is 250 m3 (40% of which is suspension). This volume guarantees sufficient wastewater containment for detoxication. In exceptional cases (malfunction of the striper, malfunction in the production of cyanide, shut down of HCN or cyanide production) the WWTP-detoxication sump is used for disposal of wastewater from the cyanide production or HCN. This wastewater is more toxic with values can range in the thousands of mg CN-/l. The volume of wastewater that can be lead to the detoxication-WWTP is given by the method of treatment and retention of the individual apparatus for the production of HCN and cyanide, and ranges in (max.) tens of m3.Description of the activities of service staff at the WWTP - detoxication sumpThe internal guidelines PI 1201-16-02 "Detoxication sump" and TR 1201-04-02&amp;nbsp; "Detoxication sump" were issued for operation of the technology. Employees are made familiarly with theses internal guidelines which are constantly made available and are obliged to follow them. Wastewater discharge is recorded on the form "summery of pumped sumps, volumes of wastewater and consumption of raw materials". The detoxication process and results of analytical evaluation are written on the operational sheet "Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)". Apart from during the main shift, analytical evaluation is performed at the weekends and during unmanned shifts by the water management laboratories at LZD. During the main shift analytical evaluation is performed during inter-operational controls. The results are recorded in the relevant laboratory logs and on the operation sheet "Detoxication sump (pumping, treatment)". Technological regulation in Chapter 7.1. Deviations from the normal technological regime includes the procedure during treatment and discharge of wastewater for possible very alkaline water, large volumes of cyanide ions and in the case that the wastewater can no be treated using the standard methods. In this case it is permitted to pump the wastewater over a longer period of time in order to reach the required limit concentrations. The values of contamination in the discharged wastewater from the LZD site in indicator CN ions (toxic and total) are set by a valid permit issued by the relevant water management authority, which is the environmental and agriculture department of the regional office of the central Bohemian region. The permit was issued 17.8.2004 and is valid to 31.12.2006.Values for wastewater discharged from the LZD site are as follows:- CNtox&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 mg/l- CNtotal&amp;nbsp; 10 mg/l&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; All activities were performed by the service staff during the accident of the 9.1.2006 according to the above-mentioned technological documentation. The only error of the service staff was to not secure the pumping hose and to not pay adequate attention during pumping. On the other hand though, the WWTP - detoxication sump is not an area that is permanently manned i.e. staff members perform other duties in conformity with their work responsibilities, the WWTP - detoxication sump therefore is not constantly manned.Another error of service staff was to not inform superiors or investigators of the accident of the hose that was pulled out and lying on the edge of the sump.5. Conclusion:On the basis of the internal investigation of committee the following conclusions have been made:The accident of 9.1.2006 occurred due to several factors. The low temperatures had a negative effect on the formation of nontoxic forms of cyanide and on the floating signalization gauge.&amp;nbsp; This however was not the main cause of the accident. The Commission states that the service staff of the WWTP - detoxication sump in essence acted in conformity with valid internal guidelines, even though the accident occurred, whose cause was the carelessness of service staff, and in particular:1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; insufficient securing or no securing at all of pump hose during pumping wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2. 2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; carelessness during pumping of wastewater from sump 3 to sump 2, and not discovering that the pump hose on the edge of the sump was extracted, which was most probably the cause of the release of toxic wastewater to the company's sewerage system and subsequently to the Labe.3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; not informing subordinates of the extracted pump hose on the edge of the sump, and subsequently not informing management during the investigation of the accident.Criminal responsibility of service staff flowing from the above mentioned errors is in the full competence of the authorities acting in legal procedures.After evaluating the adopted measures, both immediate and subsequent, the Commission states that the scope of these measures was and is adequate for the occurrence of an emergency situation and that all measures are duly fulfilled.Done in Kolin 31.3.2006Signatures of Committee Members:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Ing.

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The main points are as follows:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - There was no UVCE (Unconfined Vapour Cloud Explosion) because the product was already at a temperature higher than its flash point.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - It was possible to limit damage due to the fact that the heat resisting lines and reactors did not fail, in spite of the low flow rate of the charge within vessels and pipework, the flow of the charge being&amp;nbsp; an essential element for cooling the equipment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Because of the position of water curtains, the fire did not spread.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - The positioning of the curtains was sensible as regards the vertical position of the plume: This was because the choice of siting of the cannons prevented any domino effect which there could well have been in view of the configuration of the site (units separated by bays about fifteen metres wide).Technical issues: improvements to limit the consequences of a similar leak are as follows:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Increase of the decompression speed of the reactor section of the reformer by changing a gas venting valve to an oil-gas system.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Modification of a pressure relief valve currently operated at a pressure threshold, it will now be controllable from the control room console.Organisational issues: the operator has implemented dimensional inspection procedures for seal seats in exchangers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - Special approval is now required for personnel undertaking this type of work, with the corresponding appropriate training,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - For outside contractors doing this type of work, the introduction of routine dimensional inspection reports on the seal seats and stop points are scheduled after upgrading, before finalising assembly and during reassembly.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Locking of the feed unit for phosphorus trichloride upstream of the heat exchanger in the event of the overfill warning alarm going off at the existing flow measuring point.
Enhanced quality assurance in future procurement of comparable heat exchangers.
Increase in the diameter of the vent line at the condensate collecting tank in order to prevent the syphon from emptying there and thereby to avoid any intake via the building’s air extraction system and prevent the possibility of fire breaking out and spreading in the exhaust duct.
Additional monitoring of the filling level in the syphon of the condensate collecting tank for improved detection of the syphon emptying.
Additional monitoring of methane in the vent line of the condensate collecting tank.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">At approx. 07:00 the inlet and return valves of the production pipeline were opened and the TDI circulated (preparatory work for starting up the TDI cooling water system).
At approx. 07:15 the pressure relief valve in the cooling water circuit activates. Cooling water is allowed to drain.
From approx. 07:15 staff look for fault.
From approx. 08:30 support from outside firm. Cause of fault: mix-up in pipelines. Water ingress into TDI tank not apparent.
At approx. 11:30 steam generated in TDI store. Operating crew check TDI store. Company management informed immediately. Production manager at a subsidiary site and the ISOPA emergency call centre contacted for advice.
At approx. 12:43 emergency call to fire service because increased steam generation visible.
At approx. 13:00 first emergency service staff arrive on site. Emergency service staff immediately take the appropriate safety measures: water curtain outside (building), tank, i.e. tank walls, cooled from outside (also by spraying), danger areas sealed off, public alerted by police loudspeaker messages, radio announcements (‘Please stay indoors and keep doors and windows closed’).
At approx. 13:15 competent authorities and appointed external accident coordinator informed by company management. - The company (workshop management) made an emergency call to the fire brigade,
- Members of staff at the plant were evacuated in accordance with the emergency plan and proceeded to the assembly point,
- Fire brigade and other emergency services (police) attended the scene,
- Emergency services set up a water curtain (building),
- Tank, i.e. tank walls, cooled from outside (also by spraying), - Danger areas sealed off,
- Local residents alerted by police loudspeaker messages, radio announcements,
- Nearby facilities at plant secured (building and separation/decoupling of nearby components (equipment/pipelines),
- Immediate notification sent to competent authority, - Information sheet produced and distributed to local residents,
- Measurements (atmospheric measurements) taken by fire brigade,
- Network of approximately 25 technical experts and consultants set up on-site in order to develop essential safety measures further (including additional cooling of damaged tank, tank recovery, securing neighbouring components, official information, etc.).</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Technical measures:
- Measuring and control equipment: to protect employees in the event of an incident a large number of measuring and control devices were installed, e.g. pressure monitors, temperature monitors, overfill protectors, filling level monitors, water monitors, TDI sensors, etc.
- Marking of TDI pipelines and storage tanks: all TDI pipelines and storage tanks were colour-coded. The suction and pressure lines on TDI pumps were marked in different colours. Signs were also put up with the substance names and flow direction.
- Installation of a TDI monitor which gives an acoustic and optical alarm on site if a limit value of 0.5 ppb is exceeded.
- Reduction of the TDI storage capacity.
- Replacement of the traditional heat exchanger with a safety heat exchanger. This ensures that no coolant comes into contact with TDI or enters the TDI circuit, and that no TDI enters the cooling circuit. Organisational measures:
- Setting up of an emergency service (alarm system sends text message to mobile phone).
- Review of the plant alarm and contingency plan and introduction of a local incident commander.
- Review of operating instructions, such as conduct in the event of an alarm in the TDI part of the plant, operating instructions for the organisation of the emergency service, goods-in checks and unloading TDI tankers, operating instructions for the TDI monitors, instructions for outside firms.
- Review of and training in the ‘work permit’ procedure: for work involving particular risks, such as working at height, working with hazardous substances, etc. a work permit must be issued and all the necessary data documented.
- Review of the inspection and maintenance plan: drawing up an inspection register with all routine inspections. As a precautionary measure to limit the effect of incidents, a number of technical and organisational measures were laid down and implemented. Other measures included adding a systematic incident assessment to the safety report. A total of three incident assessments were drawn up.
The incident assessments will be routinely reviewed.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Ministry of Agriculture took precautionary measures. The concentration of toxic materials in the water, soil and grass was measured. Milk from cows in the area was destroyed.Emergency measures - Remarks: The Ministry of Health advised against the consumption of products grown in gardens or vegetable gardens within a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the fire. The Ministry of Agriculture ordered restrictive measures for farms in the vicinity (up to a distance of 30 kilometres from the fire). Cattle were put into the stable, grass was not used as cattle-fodder and milk was collected separately. A few days later, tests showed that only grass samples within a distance of 1.5 kilometres from the fire were contaminated. Milk samples were not contaminated. The preventive measures concerning milk were therefore lifted. The preventive measures concerning cattle and grass were lifted except for farms in the 1.5 kilometres zone. For those farms, the preventive measures were only lifted after the grass had been mowed and destroyed. Concerning the on-site clean-up operation: An estimate of 3400 m3 fire-water (mixed with sewage) was transported to a disposal facility. Several areas on the property of ATF De Pijp were contaminated due to firewater run-off and cleaning operations. 691.460 tonnes of contaminated soil were excavated and transported to a disposal facility.Official action taken - legal action: Penal investigationOfficial action taken - other official action: see 1d. Furthermore the permit for operating the installation was partially withdrawn. To resume the company's activities an adapted working procedure has been drawn up. This working procedure is based on daily removal of waste materials. Local authorities also ordered a screening for toxic substances of objects in the vicinity of the site.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures&amp;nbsp; to mitigate consequences: The depot was equipped with an automatic hi-ex firefighting system with inside air. After smoke detection the foam fire extinguisher was activated. This has presumably prevented the fire from spreading for several hours, but has not led to complete extinguishing of the fire. The extinguisher installation did not work flawlessly. Part of the foam was lost through open hatches at the bottom of the depot. However, there are no indications that this significantly reduced the effectiveness of the installation. Therefore the effectiveness of the hi-ex foam extinguisher, whether or not equipped with inside air, in extinguishing fires in chemical depots must be questioned. The Committee Prevention of Disasters (CPR), which recommends the use of this particular fire fighting system in its guideline CPR 15, has ordered further investigation into this subject.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

During the incident the overall response by the internal intervention
team was adequate. Sprinklers were activated instantaneously. The foam
system was activated 2 minutes after the event and after blocking the
sprinkler system. The pool fire was fed on a continuous basis by back
flow of cumene. The external fire brigade was warned at 14.02.
Arrival external fire brigade at 14.24. 
The intervention team and the external fire brigade managed to separate an area of 10 by 10m by installing a water curtain. 
The overflow of the bund created a supplementary problem. The fire was
spread over a larger area which enabled more damage to electrical cable
trenches.&amp;nbsp; Additionally minor soil contamination was introduced by the
overflow. 
The overflow was&amp;nbsp; a direct consequence of&amp;nbsp; a loss of the power supply
of sump pumps and the absence of an additional emergency overflow
The duration of the event was prolonged by the lack of effective means
to stop the back flow of cumene on short notice. At 15.20 the back flow
was stopped, leading to total control of the situation at 15.25.
During the whole event foam and water supply proved to be sufficient at al times.
The emergency response team acted conform internal procedure, except
for the external communications to neighbouring companies and one local

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
HSE believes that the deaths were preventable. The fact that the tank contained flammable material emerged several times, but the Operator did not take the opportunity to train staff and update their systems. Any change of plant operation should be critically risk assessed, adequately controlled and relevant systems updated accordingly, to ensure the significance of a newly generated hazard is not lost over time. This is particularly important where hazardous waste streams are recycled back into the process.
Other opportunities to prevent the explosion were also missed. Two days before the incident, a gas test indicated a potentially explosive atmosphere within the tank, but this information was either not shared or acted upon by those planning or carrying out the job. Companies should reflect upon this failure and review their own systems to ensure that they provide training and arrangements for the recording and communication of important safety-critical information.
This incident clearly demonstrates that safety management systems are only effective when robustly audited, monitored and enforced. Safety arrangements that have been allowed to degrade over time become weak and ineffective. Whilst providing an illusion of safety and risk control, as seen in this case, ineffective systems do not remain strong enough to prevent real harm occurring. This prosecution serves as a reminder to those with a responsibility for employees and contractors to actively monitor their safety management system arrangements and ensure they are effective in keeping workers safe.
Broader lessons
The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.
A risk assessment and the establishment of clear work instructions for any tank cleaning operation should be conducted by trained and competent staff.
To organise the work as safely as possible, the planning and preparation work should be based on knowledge of the hazardous tank contents, combined with a good understanding of and adherence to the published HSE guidance and specific tank cleaning standards, for example the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Tank Cleaning Safety Code.
HSE believe there are some clear lessons to be learned for all businesses in relation to safety management systems. Our recommendations are set out below.
1.&amp;nbsp; Process safety performance indicators
Effective management of major hazards requires a proactive approach to risk management. Information to confirm that critical systems are operating as intended is essential. Carefully chosen process safety performance indicators can monitor the status of key systems, providing assurance that major hazard risks are under control or an early warning, should controls deteriorate. HSE publication HSG254 Developing process safety indicators: A step-by-step guide for chemical and major hazard industries contains practical information.
2. Process modification and the management of change
Process modifications, in this case converting the ARU from an open to a closed system, should not be undertaken without having carried out a safety, engineering and technical review. Risk assessment should then identify what hazards have been created by the change that may affect plant or personnel safety, and what action can be implemented to reduce or eliminate the risk.
Changes may affect other parts of the plant which may be remote from the source of the change. Therefore, all parts of the plant should be considered in undertaking hazard identification and risk assessments. Additional hazards that may be introduced which need to be considered include fire, explosion and loss of containment. Further guidance can be found within HSE publication L111 The Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 2015: Guidance on Regulations.
3. Safety-critical communications
A communications protocol should be developed and embedded within the workplace for the transmission of safety-critical information. In this case the %LEL reading that was taken from the top of the tank on 31 May 2011. For effective communication, information to be shared should be conveyed through more than one medium, for example oral and written, combined with clarification and confirmation offered by the recipient. Clearly this relies upon employers ensuring that those involved in a task understand what constitutes safety-critical information. HSE publication HSG48 Reducing error and influencing behaviour contains relevant guidance.
4. Competence management systems
Hazard identification, risk assessments and risk controls are all essential elements in ensuring that effective workplace precautions are implemented. Systems need to be in place to ensure that those carrying out these tasks are trained and competent, and that their work is monitored by competent managers.
Employers should ensure that an effective competence management system is in place, so that staff are adequately trained and competent to undertake the tasks for which they are responsible. This should include arrangements for limiting staff engagement in complex safety-critical activities, when deputising for senior colleagues. The Office of Rail and Road publication Developing and maintaining staff competence provides useful guidance.
5.&amp;nbsp; Management of contractors
The law requires that companies should possess clear and accurate information regarding hazardous material stored within tanks. Furthermore, all employees and contractors involved in planning and maintenance activities on tanks should know and understand the dangers presented by the materials inside. This should include rigorous analysis (including sampling when appropriate) of the hazards of all constituents remaining within the tank prior to starting removal work. Section 2.5 of the Energy Institute’s Model Code of Safe Practice Part 16: Guidance on Tank Cleaning contains detailed information regarding pre-cleaning checks and inspections.
Companies engaged in the use of contractors should assume the role of an ‘intelligent customer’, rather than relying solely upon the contractor’s knowledge and experience. An intelligent customer will establish the regulatory and industry standards to which the contractor is expected to conform. The company will use this information to supervise the contractor’s performance and verify the adequacy of work carried out on its behalf. The Office of Nuclear Regulation guide Licensee Core Safety and Intelligent Customer Capabilities provides useful information.
6.&amp;nbsp; Contractor competence
Contracting companies should understand HSE legislation, guidance and industrial standards relevant to their work activities. Technical requirements associated with topic-specific guidance, such as tank cleaning, should form a critical part of safety management systems. This is particularly important in relation to risk assessment, established systems of work, the procurement of work equipment, training and competence assessment.

The method employed is failure points identification by current leakage detection. The control of the 7430 meters long pipe-line was performed. The method employed is failure points identification by current leakage detection. 17 failure points were found in the pipeline section named as "upstream" section&amp;nbsp; corresponding to the section between the coast and the intermediary storage facility, and 9 failure points were found in the pipeline section called "downstream" corresponding to the section between the intermediate storage facility and the power plant .It was decided to investigate (digging, thickness measurements, metallurgical tests etc.) the failure points of the pipe-line according to a prioritization scale based on the level of importance of the failures identified.The Departmental Directorate of Agriculture and Forests (DDAA) in charge of the environmental police performed the monitoring of the soil- and groundwater- pollution.Moreover the operator has appointed a consultancy firm to:- clean up the polluted ground without stopping the pipe-line activity- decontaminate and dispose of the stored materials - clean up of the polluted underground watershed</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Concerning repair operations the operator has included in the parts management system all available elements to reduce the impact of new leakages.From the material aspect,:- the method adopted to identify failures (current leakage detection) has proven to be effective and it is planned to extend the use of this method also to the other pipe-lines in the area affected by the rise of brackish water; in accordance with the results, it is planned to integrate this kind of control as well as the frequency in the context of an amendment to the Monitoring and Response Plans which will&amp;nbsp; also provide for the regular control of the pipeline systems.Depending on the results of the tests the hypothesis of replacing entire pipe-lines or certain sections will be discussed. The mutual exchange of information between the Municipality and the operators was organised in the presence of the competent authorities DDAF; DDASS; DRIRE.In the context of a better information on hazardous underground structures an inter-organisational geographical information system (GIS) is under development; it will inform civil engineering companies about the pathways of underground pipe-lines and underground electric lines.&amp;nbsp; </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The porter alarmed the fire alarm centre of fire-chief headquarters after detecting the fire by direct fire alarm phone. Extinguishing of fire was not attempted by plant personnel until arrival of fire brigade. Porters opened the entrance gates and started alarming the management of the company. The chief of fire alarm centre retrieved the fire-fighting plan of the establishment from the computer database and started execution of prescribed III. Order alarm (alarming 14 units in the first circle). The arriving units performed marching within the norm time arriving at 08:58, there was no adversely effecting factor hindering the marching of fire brigades. The fire-fighting leader confirmed the fire order III classification on the basis of exploration at site, but because of rapid spreading of fire in large area it was classified to V order at 09:06. The fire alarm centre executed the V. order alarming very fast (alarming further 6 units). Involvement of further units were necessary for exchange (from 09:42 9 units) and later for cleanup work and exploration (6 units). Aggregately 36 fire-engines and 143 firemen arrived to the fire site. According to the exploration the storage building was entirely in fire, and the fire was endangering the open air storage area next to the storage building. In spite of quick intervention the propagation of fire could not prevented, the plastic canisters located on palettes were molten and linseed oil stored in canisters burned and like burning lava flow away directly endangering the jet directing firemen and fire-engines. It is necessary to note, that the fire-chief was not aware of the content of plastic canisters, he got no information regarding this matter at site. The burning liquid spilled in the yard endangered the two neighboring buildings (paint storages), spreading the fire to these buildings would result in incalculable consequences. Because of rapid spreading of fire the alarm classification the fire-fighting leader increased the alarm classification order at 09:06. He concentrated the forces to this place for prevention of propagation of fire.The fire was extinguished using 36 fire engines and 143 firemen during 9 hours 1 minute. The tremendous amount of combustible material, which was stored in different vessels on palettes made the fire-fighting very dangerous and difficult. From the fire signalization arriving in the same time one could come to the conclusion that large fire occurred. The alarm centre made alarming according to the fire fighting plan, made preparation for alarming of forces prescribed for assistance. The exploration was not hindered, the detached storehouse and its surrounding was well-arranged.The fire escalate in very short time to the entire area of the storehouse. The heat radiation was very intensive, but the intervention prevented escalation of fire to the adjacent storehouses. Prevention of damage in the close vicinity of storehouse was not possible, materials, vehicles located there were seriously damaged. Because of stored different type of chemicals there was explosion danger and pollution effect of released combustion products represented serious endangerment for the environment. It was late information for the fire-fighting brigade that person is present in the storehouse. It was problem, that nobody could give information about types of stored materials at site. The fire-fighting management was performed at the beginning by basic management mode, later the by the organization of fire-fighting group. 4 brigades were organized: 1-1 brigade on the left and right sides of the storehouse 1 brigade for ensuring fire-fighting material supply1 brigade for ensuring fire -fighting water supply.The role of management staff which was complemented with principals arriving to the site was consultative, because of static fire-fighting situation. Good co-operation between management staff and fire-fighting leader facilitated the success of new tactical solution used at first time. Combined extinguishing method was determined for extinguishing of the fire: extinguishing with powder -gusher, foam-gusher and foam jets the cooling with water jets. Using powder gushers burning of liquid spilled in the yard managed to cease, and fire in the storehouse partly control. The very intensive foam braking effect of burning materials no foam cover could formed, because 80-90% of foam was destroyed in short time. Operation of 12-15 simultaneous foam jet would be required for successful fire-fighting, but only one foam-gusher was available on duty in the capital. The series of explosion of storage vessels reignited several times the already extinguished fire. Use of AKG-800 foam-maker for forming ensured successful fire-extinguishing because of 1,5-2 meters high foam-covering. The large weight of AKG-800 foam-maker and its manual transportation in very dangerous site represented large difficulty; the fire members of fire-fighting group had no previous information about the equipment. Injuries occurred in spite of necessary care and disciplined observation of accident prevention measures, serious injury did not occurred, fast reaction of gusher-leaders saved colleagues in danger. Heat resistant protective clothing was not used, because it was obvious that the fire extinguishing will take longer than 20 minutes time. Heat resistant protective clothing the visibility is restricted, the movement is hard, in case of present fire observation of large area and fast reaction was necessary because of rapid changes. As result of high heat radiation the external surface of conventional protective coat was melted. The medical ambulance cars of emergency department ensured the treatment and transportation to hospital of injured people. The police closed down properly the surrounding area, executed the necessary traffic control. The police took part in information and rescuing of residential people, ensuring the public order. Experts of Sewage Company On The Basis Of received in time information took the necessary measures, as a result no contaminated fire-fighting water entered into the river Danube. Food supply of fire-fighting staff working continuously for many hours was not properly organised, 4 hours was necessary to organise the requested food supply by on duty officer of the Fire-Fighting Headquarter. </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence: Strengthening the surveillance safety. There are few tools available for fire prevention of such and similar actions. The fire protection authority shall make the necessary measures during installation of facility, compliance with regulations and observing the operation instructions determined by plant shall be checked. It is suggested that during fire protection authority's inspection more emphasis shall be exercised to inspection of fire protection activity of the companies. The stereotyped fire protection instructions of the companies using only general terms shall be requested to be reviewed, and reworked in compliance with concrete fire protection requirements of given activity. Measures to mitigate consequences: It was proven, that high capacity foam makers might be necessary in the territory of capital. It was initiated to produce such foam makers for the capital. It is possible to reduce by seconds or minutes the time elapsing between arrival of fire signalization and initiating the fire alarm by expansion of computer system of Alarm Centre of Fire-Fighting Headquarter. It is necessary to provide suitable generally usable working clothes, boots and protective coat for the on duty staff. It is necessary to ensure protective drinks and meals supply system for staff working at accident site. </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The on-site emergency plan for a chlorine release was activated and chlorine feeding was automatically shut-off to the chlorinators in the same building. EXTERNAL TO THE ESTABLISHMENT:The off-site emergency plan for a chlorine release was instigated resulting in a major emergency response by emergency services. The local population in path of smoke plume was advised to stay indoors. The roads adjacent to the site were closed by the police causing major disruption at rush-hour.No emergency measures are still required, neither on-sit nor off-site (code 7703).Official action taken - other official action: A prohibition Notice was served by Health and Safety Executive under Health and Safety at work etc. Act 1974, Section 2.

A prohibition Notice was served by Health and Safety Executive under
Health and Safety at work etc. Act 1974, Section 2. The Notice required
the company to demonstrate that the operations in using the alloprene
dryers were safe before to bring them back into use. At the end of
1993, the plant has been permanently closed to comply with Montreal
Protocol.
Measures to prevent recurrence: The particular dryer involved in the accident was of I.C.I.'s own design (it is thought that I.C.I.are the only owners of such plant). The general lessons learned by I.C.I. are to be notified internally; also amendments to HAZOP procedures are proposed to include as assessment of ignition temperature not only of pure product but also of contaminated or partially decomposed products.Measures to mitigate consequences: After the accident, it was established to carry-out internal inquiries to determine technical causes and assess the efficacy of some on-site and off-site emergency arrangements. Also the company established to liaise with emergency services and county emergency planning department to assess and amend off-site emergency arrangements, particularly for non-CIMAH incidents.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The mixture with kerosene confers to the liquefied asphalt the properties of the kerosene. The producer of the mixture but also  their users have the responsibility to identify this risk.Measures to mitigate consequences: The increase of the distance between the tanks reduces the risk of domino effects. An area of several tens of square metres around the tanks could be subject of an impact. This area should be free of any sensible installation. The storage in underground tanks reduces the risk considerably.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Given the intensity of the fire, the operator launched the internal emergency plan at 12.10 p.m. The 750 employees were told to stay indoors. The emergency services arrived at 12.20 p.m. with 50 engines and around 100 firefighters.
The intensity of the fire and the urban location justified launching the external emergency plan.
As the site was situated beside a motorway in a built-up area, the prefect declared the external emergency plan at 1.10 p.m. Primary schools in the three nearby municipalities were ordered to keep children indoors for 1 hour. The motorway and its access roads were closed, causing numerous tailbacks. The fire was brought under control at 1.50 p.m. following a massive attack with foam monitors.

External responses: emergency medical treatment on scene by ambulance personnel and fire &amp;amp; rescue service personnel. Casualties were transported to the hospital for further treatment. The company itself ordered all work in the ceramics and masonry yard to cease. At the time of the accident there were several persons in the neigbourhood.&amp;nbsp; The emergency call was first received by the internal&amp;nbsp; industrial guard office who thereafter called the national emergency center (SOS Alarm). SOS Alarm interpreted&amp;nbsp; the call as an emission of gas and called out the fire service first.First aid was performed by workmates. However, the ambulance was in the neigbourhood and arrived on scene in about 15 minutes. One person died and one person was brought to hospital and operated on for serious facial injuries. Two other persons were sent to hospital due to minor injuries.Other workmates were assembled for a debriefing. Seveso II Duties:At the visit to the company the 24th of September 2004, the company stated that it had a term of contract with the supplier that they should supply the company with all cast compound and that the supplier owns all the casting in the torpedo car and that the company pay for the amount (kg) of pig iron that is transported in the torpedo car.The supplier had not in the safety data sheet informed that hydrogen gas is formed during the hardening process of the cast compound. They had not informed that the cast compound should not be used in enclosed spaces due to the formation of hydrogen gas.The company had internal regulations concerning "hot works" like welding. In this case the regulations were not applicable because of a lack of knowledge that hydrogen gas was formed during the hardening process. When there are special conditions the foreman must perform a risk assessment before welding (or other hot works)&amp;nbsp; and after taking necessary measures give permission to act. In this case there was no special condition as welding is generally permitted in the ceramics and masonry yard.Official Action Taken - legal action:On 10th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority immediately prohibited further maintenance work with the torpedo car. The terms to remove the prohibition were that the company should &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - carry out an investigation on the causes of the accident ,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - perform a risk assessment and &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; - remove the risks On 11th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority pronounced under penalty of a fine prohibition for the company to go on with repair work with the torpedo cars unless the following terms were fulfilled:&amp;nbsp; 1. Risk assessment concerning occupational risks with chemical substances.&amp;nbsp; 2. Risk assessment concerning work in a place where there is a risk of an explosive atmosphere.&amp;nbsp; On 18th May 2004 the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority changed the terms of prohibition from the 11th of May. In order to remove the prohibition the new terms were that the torpedo cars should be vented during repair and maintenance work.On 8th June 2004 the company informed the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority about a completed risk assessment. As can be seen from the risk assessment the risk of explosive atmospheres in the working place had been removed. The company also informed that it had exchanged the casting compound for the compound they used earlier and not the compound that was involved in the accident. On 9th June the the Swedish Work Environment Inspection Authority removed the earlier prohibition.Official Action Taken - other action:The company was reported to be legally prosecuted for the accident but the investigation was removed from the cause list. </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Measures to prevent recurrence:- The closed casting mould is replaced with an open one.- Exchange of cast compound for the compound they used earlier.- The torpedo car will be ventilated during casting cycle.- A risk assessment concerning the casting cycle had been performed - One person has been appointed as full time safety controller at the ceramics and masonry yard.- The company to perform risk assessments of every working aspect and, if necessary, change materials or routines.- Improve the routines of reporting accidents and incidents.Measures to mitigate consequences:see above</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

The pressure in the epoxidiser was reduced by using the emergency flare. This reduced the spray, and consequently an attack plan could be made. Two operators closed the blockage valve under coverage of a water spray.Official action taken - other official action: Investigation of the incident by the environmental authoritiesSeveso II duties  - remarks: One of the remarks made
by the assessment team was that a separate evacuation alarm is needed.
The actual alarm is meant to assemble, and if this alarm is sounded
more than 2 minutes, it is meant as an evacuation alarm. The assessment
team found this system inadequate in situations of acute danger (like

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The staff present started up the fire pump. At 12:40 p.m., the gas concentration in the containment bund was 33% LEL. The water spray was targeted at the butane and propane tanks. A pump attendant shut off an open valve situated at the inlet of a compressor allowing suction from the butane tank to be activated. At 12:50 p.m. the safety valves closed. At 1:00 p.m., the LPG pumps were started up again in closed circuit in order to draw up the liquid butane and release it into the vapour space so as to reduce the temperature and pressure. At 1:15 p.m., a butane tank truck was connected to one of the unloading stations. The loading arm was connected to the vapour space and the butane from the truck was emptied into the tank. This caused the pressure to quickly fall to 4.6 bar. The gas was fed into another spherical tank. At 1:20 p.m., water stopped being sprayed and normal activity resumed. At 4:20 p.m., pressure in the butane tank was 2.3 bar. Patrols to monitor the pressure in the butane tank were organised for the weekend.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">As a result of the accident, the operator took the following actions:

all possible points where the butane line and propane line could come into contact with each other were identified;
technical solutions were put in place to prevent the lines coming into contact due to human error;
a high-pressure alarm system was installed;
the utility of putting in place a high-pressure safety system was examined;
the preliminary risk analysis was supplemented and the hazard assessment was adapted;
procedures and the internal emergency plan were updated so as to describe the actions to be taken in scenarios of this type;
a procedure for unloading operations was created.

Sodium percarbonate is a strong oxidizer that may cause fire and explosion as well as intensify fire. Safety management, including training and awareness on safe handling and storage of sodium percarbonate, acceptance of incoming raw material, firefighting components and fireproofing are highlighted. The following measures are suggested:
Strengthen the safety management system

Enhance training on prevention and preparedness
Promote safe handling of substances, manufacturing processes and storage methods
Improve risk assessment on raw materials, composition (mixture), processes and equipment
Implement standards for installation and management of electrical infrastructure and equipment inside factories and warehouses
Compliance with the Fire Service Act and thorough implementation of disaster prevention measures for factories and warehouses
Ensure safety throughout operations including risk assessment in planning and development of processes as well as selection of materials, processing methods, transportation and storage
Enhance auditing and selection of suppliers to avoid importing non-compliant raw materials through an efficient&amp;nbsp; safety management system by implementing a process for inspection and thorough material acceptance inspection
Set up inspections to control whether the processing or handling of materials is not according to their specifications

Ensure thorough shipping inspection of incoming materials
Improve safety controls and structural design, including firefighting infrastructure, temperature/humidity monitoring, as well as structural components and fireproofing

A leakage causes an alarm signal in the CO-unit.3) All safety relevant faults of the CO-unit are displayed by the program and in the dryer the product feed is switched automatically over to water.4) The correct functioning of the CO-unit is regularly checked from the scrubbing tower by the CO-test-gas feeding system which has also been retrofitted.5) The CO-detection system is monitored by the process control system of the drying plant. The CO- thresholds have been corrected.6) Booster pumps were installed on the extinguishing water pipelines (respectively, on the pipe leading to the spry-dryer tower and to the tube filters) in order to raise the necessary extinguishing pressure. The booster pumps are switched on when the extinguishing system is activated and are connected to the emergency power supply.7) An air compressor, also connected to the emergency power supply, has been installed in order to guarantee the supply of air for the control of the extinguishing water valves.8) Freshwater pumps in the pumping room were connected to the emergency power supply in order to guarantee the supply of freshwater.9) According to the recommendations of the fire department, extinguishing hoses have been installed on every drying plant floor whereas the already existing dry pipe has been connected to the sprinkler system.10) Additional area drains were installed near the tube filter extraction lock of the tube filter&amp;nbsp; in order to improve the drainage capacity of extinguishing water.11) Additional detachable manholes covers were installed as measure for preventing the dust depositions in correspondence of the manholes.The personnel in charge is informed at the release of one of the 3 alert phases and the whole drying plant is inspected according to check lists for eventual deposits or smouldering nests.The already existing maintenance plan of the CO-plant, including also the maintenance service every six months by the plant manufacturer and a 4-week calibration by measurement and control -technicians, has been extended, It integrates now also the above mentioned CO-test-gas feeding&amp;nbsp; system for the functional check of the CO-system.The checklists, the emergency plan, the CO-testing system the calibration are documented in the updated process documentation system.The following safety procedures are maintained:At every product change, an optical inspection of the spray drying plant for powder deposits is performed.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The flame jet was extinguished by closing a valve located upstream of the hydrogen leak (once the valve had been closed, the flame jet gradually became smaller and smaller until the hydrogen from the installations between the valve and the leak had burnt off completely as a result of the leak). The company's emergency response team fought the (oil) fire and cooled the equipment near the flame jet so as to minimise damage. The oil fire was brought under control at about 16.10 (the fire began at about 15.45 and the leak at 15.30), which was also the time at which the fire fighters arrived. All that could be done at that point was to wait until the flame jet had stopped burning because there was no more hydrogen and to cool the neighbouring installations (-&gt;16.45)

There are currently two partial reports on this subject, which include an assessment of the plant and sub-installations before the incident and a summary description and assessment of the safety management system of the operator of the Land port.&amp;nbsp;
As the public prosecutor’s investigations and enquiries are still ongoing, the final expert report is still pending.&amp;nbsp;
Shortcomings or failures that caused the accident and its effects could not be identified.&amp;nbsp;
In his partial report, the expert proposed technical and organisational measures to further improve both the safety of the installation and the organisation, which are also being implemented:

Optimise the identification-marking method to reduce the risk of confusion when working on pipelines.
Use low-sparking tools to reduce the risk of ignition.
Fireproof coating and automatic pressure relief system of the newly built surface ethylene transmission line in order to reduce the risk of explosion in case of underfire.
Optimise the pressure relief system of the newly installed ethylene pipeline in order to reduce the quantities released in the event of leakage.
Installing fully-automatic early detection of heat in the pipeline trench to alert the on-site fire brigade more quickly.
Remotely-operated manual disconnection of all product-carrying pipelines in the trench with position feedback and ‘closed’ safety position of the fittings.

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The rapid propagation of the fire to the workshop for the production of solvent based inks prevented the on-site emergency response team from taking any action. The production was shut down, the 7 employees present in the work-shop were evacuated, then all the personnel left the establishment. The fire brigade reached the accident place 10 minutes after being automatically alerted over a direct line (TALIA system - Alarm Terminal for the Identification of Accident sources) and arrived well equipped. The fire was brought under control at 5:30 and completely extinguished at 9:30. The site was put under surveillance during the following 5 days. The installation was not equipped with an adequate retention pond; during the time needed to install containment systems the extinguishing water drained in a channel for one hour before being confined into the site storm-water system (150 m3). At 8:30 h some external companies pumped the extinguishing water into storm-water ponds (municipality, Infrastructure and Development Department) in which the extinguishing water was kept for several hours, the water gates of the storm-water ponds proved not to be waterproof. Shortly after the Classified Installations Inspectorate (DRIRE) observed a pollution of the river Matz. The polluted effluents were in the end evacuated by road tankers for disposal.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">This accident led the site operator to completely modify the ignition sequence of a superheater in order to limit the risk of repeating such an accident, in terms of both probability of occurrence and consequences; these efforts consisted of: - introducing a programmable and servo-controlled automaton requiring all start-up stages to be performed, namely: o steam sweeping; o pilot ignition; o burner ignition. - setting up a control chart that comprises, among other things, the pilot lighting sequence and the procedure for remote-controlled valves. This measure made it possible for personnel to initiate the superheater ignition sequence remotely, thus limiting their exposure in the event of explosion.
Additionnaly, it stressed the fact that a safety barrier shall not be bypassed, even if its use is very rare during normal operation as it was designed for the steam cracker start up (once every 6 years, but once or twice a year according internal sources). This accident also questionned the plant's technician perception of risks and safety barrier efficiency.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Emergency on-site system for both GATX and the adjacent LPG plant belonging to BP instituted.Emergency measures - Remarks: Very prompt reaction by fire brigade in accordance with prearranged plan. 54 firemen and ambulance service and police involved.Official action taken - legal action: Prosecution of firm under Ss 2(1) and 3(1) of HSW Act 1974. Fine of 75,000 Pounds imposed on each charge (total 150,000 Pounds). Costs of 20,000 Pounds paid by firm.Official action taken - other official action: Prohibition notice issued preventing use of Hamer blinds unless proper arrangements for detecting pressure and collecting spillage are made. Notice complied with by replacing blinds with double block and bleed valves (cost 100,000 Pounds).Discussion about response: This major incident was a result of: 1) Poor choice of control equipment. The Hamer blinds were unsuitable for this type of control because they opened the system. 2) Inadequate systems of work which did not recognise potential for failure (the firms risk assessment only foresaw minor spillages); and 3) poor training and supervision (fire check non-return valves were allowed to be left open). A precis of the judges findings is attached for information.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>

is means for detecting pressure and safely directing material into
closed containers. There are issues here relating to other petroleum
terminals elsewhere in the country who use this type of valve to close
off lines.Measures to prevent recurrence: Routine opening of closed containment is unacceptable unless a strict operational procedure (written) is used. A much better system is the one now adopted (double block and bleed valves).Measures to mitigate consequences: The use of SPADE valves for these types of operation should be discouraged.Useful references: (1)  Loss Prevention in the Process Industries FP Lees 1989: (2)  Oil Industry Advisory Committee "Guidance on permits to work"; (3)  Institute of Petroleum model codes of practice Nos 2 and 19; (((4) Fire precautions at Petroleum Refineries and Bulk Storage Installations and Marketing safety code )).</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">In the hours and days following the accident, the following measures were taken:

local and central authorities were informed, as were the Hungarian authorities;
partial closure of the dam (31 January 2000 - 2 February 2000, 1:30 a.m.) followed by the restoration and strengthening of the pond wall;
neutralisation of leaked water with sodium hypochlorite;
monitoring water quality by carrying out systematic tests of rivers and sources of drinking water;
supplying inhabitants of Bozanta Mare with drinking water;
discharge of water from the Aurul pond into the Remin pond (situated nearby) and, after neutralisation, into the Lăpuş river in order to maintain a constant level of water in the pond.

The measures taken by the Hungarian authorities included public warnings, work in the ponds and lakes to ensure the protection of tributaries and fauna, the temporary closure of the Kiskore dam (upper Tisa) to increase water levels and the temporary closure of the Tisa water intake for the city of Szolnok. The dam was reopened when the contaminated water arrived, in order to allow it to rapidly pass through, thus preventing the contamination of the lake and secondary watercourses.Yugoslavia received an official communication from Hungary about the leak on 3 February. Cooperation with Hungary was good throughout the leak incident. Yugoslavia began monitoring the leakage on 10 February and, concurrently, Yugoslav authorities launched a call for water companies to inform all consumers and to close all water supply points. Hydraulic gates prevented cyanide leakage from affecting secondary channels and watercourses along the Danube.A ban was placed on fishing and the sale of fish and publicly announced. Other preventive measures taken to protect public health were put in place, including the closure of Belgrade’s water supply. The information exchanges between Romanian, Hungarian and Yugoslav authorities, as well as the measures taken by all three countries, including the temporary closure of the Tisa dam, reduced the harmful impact of the leakage.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">
Increased need for objective and accurate information, in particular from local authorities and the media, was identified. Communication channels must be improved and NGOs and other interest groups must contribute to informing the public.
An emergency plan for an improved system must be drawn up and made known to local workers and decision-makers. Organisational responsibilities with regard to future instances of dam ruptures must be made clear. Rapid-response emergency alarms must be put in place, especially in Baia Mare.
It is necessary to identify sources of drinking water in case of an emergency, to carry out a study on the health of the population living in the affected areas and to monitor diseases caused by water pollution. Last but not least, drinking water supply systems for private households in Maramureș County must be replaced by public supply systems, accompanied by waste treatment systems.

The internal rescue team was alerted at 15:45, and at 15:47 the 1 500 employees of the platform (refinery + petrochemicals) were ordered to remain indoors. The operator launched the internal operating plan at 15:50 and the internal rescue team installed water curtains around the unit. The public rescue services sent a fire officer to the operator's facility.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Below are the lessons learned by the operator:
-	this type of equipment is difficult to inspect, because a single non-compliant bend out of 368 caused the accident;
-	the inspections carried out were appropriate for detecting zones of erosion in the bends, which can be found by radiography because of their highly irregular surface. However, the method was unsuitable for this type of corrosion, located downstream from the seam joint on the right side of the tube, resulting in an even surface with very irregular wear on the edge of the seam joint.
The operator decided to install during the next stoppage in 2012 new air coolers using metal that is more resistant to this type of corrosion and a design better adapted to bends/seam joints.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The site was secured and the automatic sprinkler system was activated. The internal operating plan was launched at 9:45; the rescue services were alerted and gas detection measures reinforced. A security perimeter was established and three neighbouring buildings occupied by members of the police force and their families (150 people) were evacuated. Traffic on the N193 was interrupted, which affected access to the airport and caused disturbances for 50% of passengers at boarding. Firemen regularly measure the amount of combustible and explosive gases at and outside the site. The liquid phases of LPG are emptied by fire trucks and removed by clients. LPG is transferred between the storage tanks in question gradually as the valves of each tank are replaced after they have been put under atmospheric pressure. As valves needed to be delivered for the repair of the third tank, it was taken out of service. During the emptying phase, the walls of the retention troughs and the related compressed air networks broke under pressure from the water accumulated during the sprinkling of the tanks; when the bleed valves lost their air supply, they closed automatically and consequently the transfer of propane was stopped until the personnel could restore the network. Road traffic was re-established at 21:30 once the situation was under control. The internal operating plan was lifted at 5:30 the next morning and the rescue services finished their work at 6:30. On 25 May, a specialised company carried out non-destructive testing on the tanks to verify that there were no cracks.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The operator will examine which work procedures need to be implemented or changed (permit for crane work, working at heights, etc.). It plans to carry out the work on tanks filled up to the minimum level and to perform manual operations, if necessary.
While the rescue services were at work, the motor of one of the two seawater pumps supplying the fire fighters overheated after being used non-stop for 18 hours and due to blockage of some of the suction strainers. Despite a loss of efficiency, the water supply to the fire main remained sufficient. The freshwater pump was used as a backup. During the emptying phase, the walls of the retention troughs and the related compressed air networks broke under pressure from the water accumulated during the sprinkling of the tanks; when the bleed valves lost their air supply, they closed automatically and consequently the transfer of propane was stopped until the personnel could restore the network.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">It should be noted that there were no mandatory standards for fire safety requirements to be met by large roofs at the time the warehouse was planned and built (the standard DIN 18 234-2, for example, was not made mandatory until 1995; guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings did not then contain any specific requirements for roofs).  In future, when planning reconstruction or restoration work, the specific risk situation in the case of fire should be taken into account in addition to the requirements which must in any case be complied with.  The following points should be considered: 1. The basic separation of storage rooms for fire protection purposes must be maintained and the rooms must continue to be fitted with automatic fire alarms and extinguishing systems. 2. Taking into account the potential damage/effects caused by a fire in the storage rooms, the storage rooms should be designed as fire compartments separate from the adjacent outdoor storage areas, even if the hall would be admissible as a fire compartment according to the guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings. The walls separating the storage rooms from the adjacent areas are to be designed as fire walls and must therefore be raised to 0.50&amp;nbsp;m above the roof. 3. Regardless of whether the above recommendation on the formation of fire compartments is followed, the requirements of DIN 18 234 are to be implemented due to the particular risks involved in rebuilding the roof, even if the roof area is less than 2&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;m². Specific requirements for the construction of roofs only apply to roofs of more than 2&amp;nbsp;500&amp;nbsp;m² according to the guidelines on the construction of industrial buildings. This is important because, even if the storage room area is designed as a separate fire compartment, unless specific measures are taken when designing the roof, a fire in one of the storage rooms could spread to the other storage rooms via the roof. 4. Light domes and/or smoke and heat extraction systems in the storage rooms are to be checked in accordance with the specifications of automatic extinguishing systems. 5. Furthermore, the new warehouse must be planned in accordance with TRGS (Technical Rule for Hazardous Substances) 800 ‘Fire Protection Measures’, adopted in December 2010, the main purpose of which is to protect employees. 6. Although arson cannot always be avoided, checks should be carried out to see whether the covered, freely accessible areas on site can be protected against unauthorised access when the facility is not in operation.  With regard to fire safety requirements, a fire protection expert should be involved in planning the rebuilding of the warehouse.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

Activities, rescources, process and competency must be managed in a way that secures safe working conditions.&amp;nbsp;
Sufficient manning and competency of&amp;nbsp;all shifts&amp;nbsp;is necessary in order&amp;nbsp;to ensure safe operation.
Important information must always be logged in the shift protocol and mentioned in the shift hand over. Had this been done, the operators would not have climbed to the top of the reactor without bringing the necessary protective equipment.&amp;nbsp;
In&amp;nbsp;the handling of the emergency situation it is important that:

the organisation and responsibilities are clearly defined
necessary training in the use of emergency equipment is performed
necessary planning on how to rescue personell from&amp;nbsp;tall structures is performed and described
well functioning radio communication

These include upgrading manual valves for the supply of de-mineralised water, provision of equipment to improve ergonomics and handling of work equipment and substances, and introducing checklists for operating staff in order to safeguard procedures.All corresponding processes then underwent clearance.
A standard for the technical design of basin-filling devices has been defined and implemented.Staff in the production and planning departments have been trained.The measures taken by the operator to secure vat contents and the processes and rules implemented at the company have been verified by external experts approved under Section&amp;nbsp;29b of the Federal Immission Control Act (BImSchG).The potential minor improvements identified have been implemented / are being implemented.
Substances were not dispensed in the order provided for in the existing written work instructions. The result was an exothermic reaction. This shows how important it is to regularly and exhaustively communicate and supervise adherence to work instructions.
The use of a CO2 fire extinguisher (foam extinguishers were available as well) caused a reaction with the NaCN, generating toxic HCN (hydrogen cyanide).This shows that it is necessary to better prepare staff for handling operational malfunctions.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

During forthcoming outages (longer than 72&amp;nbsp;h), additional cyclone inspections will be scheduled. It will also be examined whether this inspection can be carried out using drones in order to minimise the time-consuming preparations, e.g. degassing and ventilation, scaffolding.
Using the existing ‘cyclone gas inlet’ temperature measurement as an indicator of possible impending damage to the cyclone (and therefore also to the dip tube), and including it to monitor furnace operations, is still under examination.

The copper contained in the rinsing water is cathodically separated by direct current in the recycling cell, whilst the cyanide ions are removed from the anodes. &amp;nbsp;Direct current is generated by a rectifier. If there is a short circuit between anode and cathode in the recycling cell, the voltage drops (towards 0 V) and the current level reaches the rectifier's capacity. As in the case of a short circuit almost the entire current flows solely via the jumper, the connectors heat up considerably which can cause plastic parts in close proximity to ignite. The voltage monitor activates a relay contact if the voltage changes. This relay contact is used to switch off the rectifier and thus prevent the components from heating up.</ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The incident was dealt with by the company following its own on-site emergency procedures. Although the County fire brigade did attend they were not required. The plant was shut down and depressurised and the Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) transferred to the emergency dump vessel. The release continued for some 84 minutes from the time the gas alarms sounded as the pressure of the plant was reduced. </ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The company was well aware that the water concentration in Hydrogen Fluoride (HF) should not exceed 2% weight to limit the corrosion of carbon steel. On recommissioning after the hydrotest, there would have been a relatively high concentration of water in the HF in the line. There is therefore nothing new to be learned with regard to this particular issue. However the company claim that the way the corrosion developed, eventually causing the failure, was unforeseen and therefore there are implications for the Risk Based Inspection (RBI) strategy it employs. The RBI methodology has been reviewed. The company has also had to review the hydrotest and drying procedures. The failed pipeline has been completely replaced and new arrangements provided for the pipeline to be dried at future shutdowns. The investigation included detailed discussions with the company regarding the level of corrosion and scaling. These will continue together with questions concerning the pressure relief arrangements for the plant.  </ns1:hasLessonsLearned>

    <ns1:hasEmergencyResponse rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Following the explosion and the noise it made, the Safety Officer (RSPP), who was in room 40 at the time, raised the alarm and the internal emergency plan was triggered. At the same time, the Safety Officer and the internal emergency response teams began checking the situation in the surrounding areas to establish whether there were any secondary fires or injuries.
A report of the accident was received in the control room of the fire brigade headquarters in Chieti at around 2:40 p.m. from the Carabinieri station in Vasto, which reported an explosion at a firework factory in the vicinity, without giving any further details.
In order to obtain more detailed information on the event, staff at the fire brigade control room immediately contacted the firm, learning that the accident had involved three workers who had unfortunately already died as a result of an explosion in room 80 at the plant. As a result, the control room immediately dispatched two crews to the accident site, from the fire stations in Vasto and Ortona respectively. The Local Command Unit and duty officer from the fire brigade headquarters in Chieti were also sent. Later on in the technical relief operation, the fire brigade control room asked for a drone team, and the national fire brigade operations centre in Rome dispatched one from Bari. The control room also asked for a team from the specialised earth-moving unit, and the Abruzzo regional fire brigade directorate dispatched one from L’Aquila.
The next day, at around 10:15 a.m., explosive ordnance disposal experts and fire fighters accessed the affected area to carry out a detailed examination of the site where the explosion occurred, before clearing the area with the remote support of an ambulance from the 118 emergency medical service.
The clearance work started at 10:40 a.m. and was completed at around 2:00 p.m., with aerial video support from the fire brigade drone. During the clearance work aimed at minimising the risk of further explosions, the disposal experts recovered all of the active explosive products still present (flares, nautical smoke signals, etc.) and moved them away from the area beneath the canopy where the explosion occurred.</ns1:hasEmergencyResponse>
    <ns1:hasLessonsLearned rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">Further work to raise awareness among those in leadership roles about supervising operations and among workers about carefully performing the tasks assigned to them. More than once, people interviewed stated that the reasons for the foreman being present in the area of the accident were not clear. Equally important, there should be awareness raising among staff so as to ensure that their years of experience do not cause them to perform operations or handle materials in an over-confident manner.Review of the procedures for moving materials, so as to be able to identify in real time all of the materials that move from the work rooms to the incineration room.Review of the operating procedures so as to ensure that the instructions in them are consistent. Examples here are procedure P.80.03 Annex 4 ‘Incineration of THUNDERFLASH pyrotechnics’ and procedure P.40.320 ‘Extraction of gunpowder from THUNDERFLASH ELECTRIC D54’, in which it is not clear whether or not water is compatible with the gunpowder extracted. Given that water is known to react with mixtures containing aluminium powders, the inspection panel believes that the practice of soaking the Thunderflash powder immediately before it is fed into the furnace was adopted without clear assessments and laboratory tests that took account of the characteristics of the product, the operations and the associated risks.Importance of managing the restart of activities following the accident and long-term closure of the plant through a training plan and programme (information-provision, training and drills) that takes account of the workers’ long period of inactivity and the resulting review of the operating procedures, as well as appropriate inspection and maintenance of the equipment that has been out of use for a long time.

VGB Powertech (association of power plant operators) was informed and a working group on boiler circulation systems was set up, in which other power plant operators and technical inspection associations participate.
The manufacturer of the circulating pump was informed and has altered the design of the circulating pump casing. The manufacturer has drawn up a list in order of priority identifying power plant operators with the same or similar circulating pumps and has written to them.
A change in the design of the pump casing with a considerably lower tension level and the implementation of a new testing approach has reduced the danger of another failure of the boiler circulating pump to a minimum. The formation of further cracks in the casing of the boiler circulating pump is almost ruled out, considering the new finite element method (FEM) calculations, and the future regular tests practically rule out the possibility of them spreading unnoticed.
In future, a mechanical phased array procedure (ultrasonic testing) will be used instead of a manual phased array procedure for the regular testing of the circulating pump casing.
